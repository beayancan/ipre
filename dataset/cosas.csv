CD010339|3242144|Value of percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (PTCS).|Since July 1975, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) has been performed in 533 cases, and since April 1977 we have developed percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (PTCS) as a diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopical tool in 198 cases of malignant disease and 195 benign cases. After dilating the sinus tract of PTBD using a 15-Fr catheter about 2 weeks after PTBD, PTCS was carried out through the sinus tract. PTCS has diagnostic advantages: the lesion can be accurately diagnosed histologically and the extent of cancer in the biliary tract can be assessed by taking biopsy specimens before the operation. PTCS has been applied for cholangioscopic lithotripsy in 145 cases of gallstone disease. In 44 cases, the Nd-YAG laser and/or electrohydraulic shock wave has been used to break up the stones. The PTCS morbidity was 6% and mortality was 0.3%.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD009323|17347632|Endoscopic management of a large choledochocele associated with choledocholithiasis.|Choledochocele or type III choledochal cyst is a very rare lesion, defined as a cystic dilatation of the distal common bile duct protruding into the duodenal lumen. Abdominal pain, biliary disorders, and acute pancreatitis are frequently observed but malignant degeneration is rare. A 70-year-old man had a history of epigastralgia associated with abnormal liver function tests suggesting gallstones. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, intraoperative cholangiography showed a 40-mm-diameter choledochocele associated with choledocholithiasis. A transcystic drain was placed after cholecystectomy had been completed. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography confirmed the diagnosis and a 45-mm-long endoscopic sphincterotomy successfully treated both lesions as confirmed by a transcystic cholangiogram showing a thin-walled common bile duct with no residual stones. This case illustrates that the diagnosis of choledochocele remains difficult in clinical practice and confirms that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is the best available diagnostic tool. Coexistent choledocholithiasis is observed in about 20% of choledochocele. Endoscopic sphincterotomy is feasible and effectively treats both lesions even in larger choledochoceles.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

CD010339|950098|The effect of loss of gallbladder function on biliary lipid composition in subjects with cholesterol gallstones.|The effect on biliary lipid and bile acid composition was assessed during the development of gallbladder nonfunction in 5 subjects with asymptomatic cholesterol cholelithiasis. There was a significant increase in the relative proportion of bile salt but a decrease in that of cholesterol in bile after development of gallbladder nonfunction which persisted after recovery from cholecystectomy. These findings were associated with a decrease in cholesterol crystals in bile sediment and an increase in the proportion of secondary bile acids after cholangiographic evidence of gallbladder nonfunction. Percentage cholesterol saturation of bile reverted to normal after development of gallbladder nonfunction which persisted after recovery from cholecystectomy.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Recent technical refinements that allow for imaging of the entire biliary tree and pancreatic duct in 18 seconds make this examination easily performed even in critically ill patients. The clinical applications of MRCP are illustrated in a variety of scenarios that include choledocholithiasis, malignant obstruction, incomplete/failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs), postsurgical alterations of the biliary tract and gastrointestinal tract such as biliary-enteric anastomoses, intrahepatic bile duct pathology such as sclerosing cholangitis and AIDS cholangiopathy, chronic pancreatitis, congenital anomalies of the biliary tract and pancreatic duct, and gallbladder pathology.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|6185702|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Diagnosis of cholelithiasis in patients with normal gallbladder x-ray and ultrasound studies.|The combination of a normal oral cholecystogram and ultrasound study of the gallbladder is considered adequate evidence to exclude cholelithiasis as a cause of biliarylike pain. We examined 206 patients with biliarylike pain and normal findings on cholecystogram and ultrasound study of the gallbladder by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Of the 195 patients who had successful ERCP, 32 patients (group 1) had mild, transient abnormalities in liver function tests and 163 (group 2) had normal liver function test results. Small gallstones were demonstrated on ERCP examination in 25 of 32 group 1 patients and in four of 163 group 2 patients, all confirmed at surgery or endoscopic sphincterotomy. In conclusion, despite negative results on cholecystogram and ultrasound study of the gallbladder, patients with biliarylike pain and abnormal liver function test results should be evaluated further by diagnostic ERCP examination.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7729265|Choledocholithiasis in patients with normal serum liver enzymes.|Retrospective chart review of 330 patients undergoing ERCP over a two-year period yielded five patients with choledocholithiasis whose serum liver enzyme and total bilirubin levels were repeatedly normal. All were female, three were elderly, and the gallbladder was in situ in three of the five, one of whom had a large gallbladder remnant. In four patients, the common bile duct was dilated (> 10 mm), whereas none had intrahepatic duct dilatation. Four patients had a prominent ampulla, and stone size varied widely. Each patient was managed with endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction followed by cholecystectomy for the four patients with the gallbladder or its remnant in situ. This small series proves that common duct stones may exist in patients with repeatedly normal serum liver enzyme and total bilirubin levels.

CD011548|7729265|Choledocholithiasis in patients with normal serum liver enzymes.|Retrospective chart review of 330 patients undergoing ERCP over a two-year period yielded five patients with choledocholithiasis whose serum liver enzyme and total bilirubin levels were repeatedly normal. All were female, three were elderly, and the gallbladder was in situ in three of the five, one of whom had a large gallbladder remnant. In four patients, the common bile duct was dilated (> 10 mm), whereas none had intrahepatic duct dilatation. Four patients had a prominent ampulla, and stone size varied widely. Each patient was managed with endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction followed by cholecystectomy for the four patients with the gallbladder or its remnant in situ. This small series proves that common duct stones may exist in patients with repeatedly normal serum liver enzyme and total bilirubin levels.

CD010339|16957653|Endoscopic approach to acute pancreatitis.|This review focuses on the use of endoscopic techniques in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic disorders. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been used primarily to evaluate and treat disorders of the biliary tree. Recently, endoscopic techniques have been adapted for pancreatic sphincterotomy, stenting, stricture dilation, treatment of duct leaks, drainage of fluid collections, and stone extraction via the major and minor papillae. In patients with acute and recurrent pancreatitis, ERCP carries a higher than average risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis. This risk can be reduced with the placement of a prophylactic pancreatic stent. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) can establish the anatomy of the biliary and pancreatic ducts, identify pancreas divisum or pancreatic ductal strictures, depict bile duct stones, and demonstrate pancreatic or biliary duct dilation. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) provides a safer, less invasive, and often more sensitive measure for evaluating the pancreas and biliary tree, and allows some options for therapy. In acute and recurrent pancreatitis, EUS and MRCP can be used to establish a diagnosis; ERCP can be reserved for therapy.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|9512805|Hepatolithiasis and biliary parasites.|Hepatolithiasis, or the presence of intrahepatic stones, is prevalent in East Asia and is characterized by the finding of stones within the intrahepatic bile ducts proximal to the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts. Bile stasis and bacterial infection have been incriminated as the major aetiopathogenic factors. Clinical features include recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, multiple liver abscesses, secondary biliary cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma. The goals of management include accurate localization of pathologies, control of biliary sepsis and the elimination of stones and stasis. Ultrasonography, computed tomography and direct cholangiography complement each other in defining the stones, strictures and degree of liver damage. Non-operative biliary decompression by endoscopy and interventional radiology is effective in controlling the infection, but surgery remains the mainstay for the treatment of stones and strictures. Intra-operative ultrasound and flexible choledochoscopy, combined with percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy and intraductal lithotripsy, facilitate stone removal. Balloon dilatation and biliary stenting serve to open the bile duct strictures. The creation of a hepaticocutaneous jejunostomy after conventional surgery allows atraumatic access to the biliary system for the removal of recurrent stones. The management of biliary parasites begins with conservative measures, including analgesics and anti-helminthic therapy. In refractory cases or patients with acute cholangitis, endoscopic biliary drainage and the extraction of worms may be necessary. Improvement in sanitation plays a crucial role in the epidemiological control of these biliary diseases.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7665868|Magnetic resonance imaging for the visualization of cholesterol gallstones in hamster fed a new high sucrose lithogenic diet.|Cholesterol gallstone induction in hamster gallbladder is usually achieved by specific diets. An X-ray in vivo follow-up of cholelithiasis development in this species is impossible, since cholesterol gallstones are transparent as long as they are not calcified. Moreover, their size (0.2 to 1 mm) also prevents their detection by ultrasonography. The current study presents an in vivo cholesterol gallstone detection by magnetic resonance imaging in hamsters fed a new high sucrose diet containing a low proportion of cholesterol (0.015%) and a normal ratio of lipids (10%). The diet produced gallstones and an increase in the cholesterol saturation index in about 50% of animals after a 5-week feeding period. The visualization of gallstones by magnetic resonance imaging in anaesthetized animals required synchronization between breathing movements and image acquisition. A high magnetic field was also necessary to allow a fine image resolution, adapted to gallstone size. Two major advantages of this technique are a direct selection of lithiasic animals with a functional gallbladder (in spite of the presence of gallstones) and a possible adjustment of the treatment period of potential litholytic drugs.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

In our study, we found--with real-time ultrasound--a prevalence of gallstones of 16% in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated with HD which is similar to the prevalence in a non-uraemic control group matched for age and sex. In most of our HD patients, cholecystolithiasis was asymptomatic. HD patients with cholecystolithiasis were statistically significantly older than patients without gallstones. We found no differences in sex or duration of HD treatment in patients with and without cholecystolithiasis.

CD010339|22497643|Common bile duct stones in infancy: a medical approach.|Symptomatic choledocholithiasis in infancy is not common. It usually presents with jaundice and acholic stools and is diagnosed on abdominal ultrasonography. Favourable outcome of conservative management has been reported, but specific management guidelines are not well defined in the literature. We describe three cases using a combination of ursodeoxycholic acid and antibiotics as a treatment paradigm, which could potentially negate more invasive treatment. All three patients had ultrasonography proven choledocholithiasis with concomitant obstructive liver function test. They were treated with a combination of ursodeoxycolic acid and antibiotics. Patient 1 had an Escherichia coli urinary tract infection and was treated with oral bactrim. Intravenous amoxicillin, gentamicin and metronidazole were used for the other two patients. All three patients responded with a return to normal-coloured stools within 48 h of combination treatment. Repeat ultrasonography done within 11 days after the first study for all three patients confirmed complete resolution of choledocholithiasis. It is postulated that this improvement is as a result of a reduction in inflammation and oedema, associated with a low-grade cholangitis, following antibiotic treatment. This is coupled with improved bile flow with ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. The findings suggest the potential application of this safe, non-invasive therapeutic strategy as initial management in infants with this condition. A follow-up prospective randomised controlled trial may be an answer to prove the validity of this observation but due to the rarity of this problem, it would be a challenge to recruit sufficient number of patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

It is also held that all cholelithiasis in infancy has a predisposing factor such as hemolysis, prolonged fasting, congenital abnormality of the biliary tree, or the administration of TPN and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. In the last three years, four infants at our hospital have been found on real-time ultrasonography to have gallstones. Their ages ranged from 3 weeks to 6 months. One patient had a hemolytic disease but the finding of cholelithiasis in the other three patients was incidental. A repeat sonogram in the infant with hemolysis three months after initial recognition and one day before scheduled cholecystectomy revealed spontaneous resolution of the gallstones. This led us to a conservative approach in the other three patients.

CD010339|7986614|[The endoscopic management of postoperative biliary fistulae].|We report a series of 15 patients with a postoperative biliary fistula treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy. The exact location of the bile leak was revealed by ERCP in 13 cases (87%): cystic duct remnant in 6 (39%), intrahepatic biliary tree in 4 (26%), and main bile duct in 3 (20%). In all cases a distal obstacle (ie: retained stones, hydatid material) to bile flow was also found in ERCP. Treatment consisted of endoscopic sphincterotomy and subsequent removal of the distal obstacle, and could be completed in 13 (87%) cases. In our experience the treatment of postoperative biliary fistula with a distal obstruction bile flow by endoscopic sphincterotomy is a safe and effective procedure, and should be recommended as the first option in those patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD009323|7866610|Common bile duct exploration: the place of laparoscopic choledochotomy.|Since laparoscopic cholecystectomy was introduced, the treatment of choledocholithiasis has been modified. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been performed selectively in elderly patients and in those with a strong suspicion of biliary duct stones (jaundice, demonstrated at ultrasound). Intraoperative discovery of common duct stones at cystic duct cholangiography signifies that they must be removed intraoperatively [or postoperatively by ERPC and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES)]. As ES has a failure rate of 3-23%, laparoscopic common duct exploration emerges as the treatment of choice. Since November 1990, we have performed 59 laparoscopic common bile duct explorations. In our experience, the transcystic technique (18 patients) with choledochoscopy appears easier to perform than with fluoroscopy without choledochoscopy. Since, during our early experience, we encountered some difficulty with the transcystic technique, we elected to evaluate common duct exploration through a choledochotomy (41 patients). The main advantage of this technique is that it provides complete access to the ductal system without damage to the papilla. This procedure seems more difficult to perform than the transcystic technique and can be used when there are contraindications to the latter.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer
