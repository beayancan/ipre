CD010339|3242144|Value of percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (PTCS).|Since July 1975, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) has been performed in 533 cases, and since April 1977 we have developed percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (PTCS) as a diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopical tool in 198 cases of malignant disease and 195 benign cases. After dilating the sinus tract of PTBD using a 15-Fr catheter about 2 weeks after PTBD, PTCS was carried out through the sinus tract. PTCS has diagnostic advantages: the lesion can be accurately diagnosed histologically and the extent of cancer in the biliary tract can be assessed by taking biopsy specimens before the operation. PTCS has been applied for cholangioscopic lithotripsy in 145 cases of gallstone disease. In 44 cases, the Nd-YAG laser and/or electrohydraulic shock wave has been used to break up the stones. The PTCS morbidity was 6% and mortality was 0.3%.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD009323|17347632|Endoscopic management of a large choledochocele associated with choledocholithiasis.|Choledochocele or type III choledochal cyst is a very rare lesion, defined as a cystic dilatation of the distal common bile duct protruding into the duodenal lumen. Abdominal pain, biliary disorders, and acute pancreatitis are frequently observed but malignant degeneration is rare. A 70-year-old man had a history of epigastralgia associated with abnormal liver function tests suggesting gallstones. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, intraoperative cholangiography showed a 40-mm-diameter choledochocele associated with choledocholithiasis. A transcystic drain was placed after cholecystectomy had been completed. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography confirmed the diagnosis and a 45-mm-long endoscopic sphincterotomy successfully treated both lesions as confirmed by a transcystic cholangiogram showing a thin-walled common bile duct with no residual stones. This case illustrates that the diagnosis of choledochocele remains difficult in clinical practice and confirms that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is the best available diagnostic tool. Coexistent choledocholithiasis is observed in about 20% of choledochocele. Endoscopic sphincterotomy is feasible and effectively treats both lesions even in larger choledochoceles.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

CD010339|950098|The effect of loss of gallbladder function on biliary lipid composition in subjects with cholesterol gallstones.|The effect on biliary lipid and bile acid composition was assessed during the development of gallbladder nonfunction in 5 subjects with asymptomatic cholesterol cholelithiasis. There was a significant increase in the relative proportion of bile salt but a decrease in that of cholesterol in bile after development of gallbladder nonfunction which persisted after recovery from cholecystectomy. These findings were associated with a decrease in cholesterol crystals in bile sediment and an increase in the proportion of secondary bile acids after cholangiographic evidence of gallbladder nonfunction. Percentage cholesterol saturation of bile reverted to normal after development of gallbladder nonfunction which persisted after recovery from cholecystectomy.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Recent technical refinements that allow for imaging of the entire biliary tree and pancreatic duct in 18 seconds make this examination easily performed even in critically ill patients. The clinical applications of MRCP are illustrated in a variety of scenarios that include choledocholithiasis, malignant obstruction, incomplete/failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs), postsurgical alterations of the biliary tract and gastrointestinal tract such as biliary-enteric anastomoses, intrahepatic bile duct pathology such as sclerosing cholangitis and AIDS cholangiopathy, chronic pancreatitis, congenital anomalies of the biliary tract and pancreatic duct, and gallbladder pathology.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|6185702|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Diagnosis of cholelithiasis in patients with normal gallbladder x-ray and ultrasound studies.|The combination of a normal oral cholecystogram and ultrasound study of the gallbladder is considered adequate evidence to exclude cholelithiasis as a cause of biliarylike pain. We examined 206 patients with biliarylike pain and normal findings on cholecystogram and ultrasound study of the gallbladder by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Of the 195 patients who had successful ERCP, 32 patients (group 1) had mild, transient abnormalities in liver function tests and 163 (group 2) had normal liver function test results. Small gallstones were demonstrated on ERCP examination in 25 of 32 group 1 patients and in four of 163 group 2 patients, all confirmed at surgery or endoscopic sphincterotomy. In conclusion, despite negative results on cholecystogram and ultrasound study of the gallbladder, patients with biliarylike pain and abnormal liver function test results should be evaluated further by diagnostic ERCP examination.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7729265|Choledocholithiasis in patients with normal serum liver enzymes.|Retrospective chart review of 330 patients undergoing ERCP over a two-year period yielded five patients with choledocholithiasis whose serum liver enzyme and total bilirubin levels were repeatedly normal. All were female, three were elderly, and the gallbladder was in situ in three of the five, one of whom had a large gallbladder remnant. In four patients, the common bile duct was dilated (> 10 mm), whereas none had intrahepatic duct dilatation. Four patients had a prominent ampulla, and stone size varied widely. Each patient was managed with endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction followed by cholecystectomy for the four patients with the gallbladder or its remnant in situ.

CD011548|7729265|Choledocholithiasis in patients with normal serum liver enzymes.|Retrospective chart review of 330 patients undergoing ERCP over a two-year period yielded five patients with choledocholithiasis whose serum liver enzyme and total bilirubin levels were repeatedly normal. All were female, three were elderly, and the gallbladder was in situ in three of the five, one of whom had a large gallbladder remnant. In four patients, the common bile duct was dilated (> 10 mm), whereas none had intrahepatic duct dilatation. Four patients had a prominent ampulla, and stone size varied widely. Each patient was managed with endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction followed by cholecystectomy for the four patients with the gallbladder or its remnant in situ.

CD010339|16957653|Endoscopic approach to acute pancreatitis.|This review focuses on the use of endoscopic techniques in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic disorders. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been used primarily to evaluate and treat disorders of the biliary tree. Recently, endoscopic techniques have been adapted for pancreatic sphincterotomy, stenting, stricture dilation, treatment of duct leaks, drainage of fluid collections, and stone extraction via the major and minor papillae. In patients with acute and recurrent pancreatitis, ERCP carries a higher than average risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis. This risk can be reduced with the placement of a prophylactic pancreatic stent. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) can establish the anatomy of the biliary and pancreatic ducts, identify pancreas divisum or pancreatic ductal strictures, depict bile duct stones, and demonstrate pancreatic or biliary duct dilation. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) provides a safer, less invasive, and often more sensitive measure for evaluating the pancreas and biliary tree, and allows some options for therapy. In acute and recurrent pancreatitis, EUS and MRCP can be used to establish a diagnosis; ERCP can be reserved for therapy.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|9512805|Hepatolithiasis and biliary parasites.|Hepatolithiasis, or the presence of intrahepatic stones, is prevalent in East Asia and is characterized by the finding of stones within the intrahepatic bile ducts proximal to the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts. Bile stasis and bacterial infection have been incriminated as the major aetiopathogenic factors. Clinical features include recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, multiple liver abscesses, secondary biliary cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma. The goals of management include accurate localization of pathologies, control of biliary sepsis and the elimination of stones and stasis. Ultrasonography, computed tomography and direct cholangiography complement each other in defining the stones, strictures and degree of liver damage. Non-operative biliary decompression by endoscopy and interventional radiology is effective in controlling the infection, but surgery remains the mainstay for the treatment of stones and strictures. Intra-operative ultrasound and flexible choledochoscopy, combined with percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy and intraductal lithotripsy, facilitate stone removal. Balloon dilatation and biliary stenting serve to open the bile duct strictures. The creation of a hepaticocutaneous jejunostomy after conventional surgery allows atraumatic access to the biliary system for the removal of recurrent stones. The management of biliary parasites begins with conservative measures, including analgesics and anti-helminthic therapy. In refractory cases or patients with acute cholangitis, endoscopic biliary drainage and the extraction of worms may be necessary. Improvement in sanitation plays a crucial role in the epidemiological control of these biliary diseases.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7665868|Magnetic resonance imaging for the visualization of cholesterol gallstones in hamster fed a new high sucrose lithogenic diet.|Cholesterol gallstone induction in hamster gallbladder is usually achieved by specific diets. An X-ray in vivo follow-up of cholelithiasis development in this species is impossible, since cholesterol gallstones are transparent as long as they are not calcified. Moreover, their size (0.2 to 1 mm) also prevents their detection by ultrasonography. The current study presents an in vivo cholesterol gallstone detection by magnetic resonance imaging in hamsters fed a new high sucrose diet containing a low proportion of cholesterol (0.015%) and a normal ratio of lipids (10%). The diet produced gallstones and an increase in the cholesterol saturation index in about 50% of animals after a 5-week feeding period. The visualization of gallstones by magnetic resonance imaging in anaesthetized animals required synchronization between breathing movements and image acquisition. A high magnetic field was also necessary to allow a fine image resolution, adapted to gallstone size. Two major advantages of this technique are a direct selection of lithiasic animals with a functional gallbladder (in spite of the presence of gallstones) and a possible adjustment of the treatment period of potential litholytic drugs.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

In our study, we found--with real-time ultrasound--a prevalence of gallstones of 16% in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated with HD which is similar to the prevalence in a non-uraemic control group matched for age and sex. In most of our HD patients, cholecystolithiasis was asymptomatic. HD patients with cholecystolithiasis were statistically significantly older than patients without gallstones. We found no differences in sex or duration of HD treatment in patients with and without cholecystolithiasis.

CD010339|22497643|Common bile duct stones in infancy: a medical approach.|Symptomatic choledocholithiasis in infancy is not common. It usually presents with jaundice and acholic stools and is diagnosed on abdominal ultrasonography. Favourable outcome of conservative management has been reported, but specific management guidelines are not well defined in the literature. We describe three cases using a combination of ursodeoxycholic acid and antibiotics as a treatment paradigm, which could potentially negate more invasive treatment. All three patients had ultrasonography proven choledocholithiasis with concomitant obstructive liver function test. They were treated with a combination of ursodeoxycolic acid and antibiotics. Patient 1 had an Escherichia coli urinary tract infection and was treated with oral bactrim. Intravenous amoxicillin, gentamicin and metronidazole were used for the other two patients. All three patients responded with a return to normal-coloured stools within 48 h of combination treatment. Repeat ultrasonography done within 11 days after the first study for all three patients confirmed complete resolution of choledocholithiasis. It is postulated that this improvement is as a result of a reduction in inflammation and oedema, associated with a low-grade cholangitis, following antibiotic treatment. This is coupled with improved bile flow with ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. The findings suggest the potential application of this safe, non-invasive therapeutic strategy as initial management in infants with this condition. A follow-up prospective randomised controlled trial may be an answer to prove the validity of this observation but due to the rarity of this problem, it would be a challenge to recruit sufficient number of patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

It is also held that all cholelithiasis in infancy has a predisposing factor such as hemolysis, prolonged fasting, congenital abnormality of the biliary tree, or the administration of TPN and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. In the last three years, four infants at our hospital have been found on real-time ultrasonography to have gallstones. Their ages ranged from 3 weeks to 6 months. One patient had a hemolytic disease but the finding of cholelithiasis in the other three patients was incidental. A repeat sonogram in the infant with hemolysis three months after initial recognition and one day before scheduled cholecystectomy revealed spontaneous resolution of the gallstones. This led us to a conservative approach in the other three patients.

The exact location of the bile leak was revealed by ERCP in 13 cases (87%): cystic duct remnant in 6 (39%), intrahepatic biliary tree in 4 (26%), and main bile duct in 3 (20%). In all cases a distal obstacle (ie: retained stones, hydatid material) to bile flow was also found in ERCP. Treatment consisted of endoscopic sphincterotomy and subsequent removal of the distal obstacle, and could be completed in 13 (87%) cases. In our experience the treatment of postoperative biliary fistula with a distal obstruction bile flow by endoscopic sphincterotomy is a safe and effective procedure, and should be recommended as the first option in those patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD009323|7866610|Common bile duct exploration: the place of laparoscopic choledochotomy.|Since laparoscopic cholecystectomy was introduced, the treatment of choledocholithiasis has been modified. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been performed selectively in elderly patients and in those with a strong suspicion of biliary duct stones (jaundice, demonstrated at ultrasound). Intraoperative discovery of common duct stones at cystic duct cholangiography signifies that they must be removed intraoperatively [or postoperatively by ERPC and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES)]. As ES has a failure rate of 3-23%, laparoscopic common duct exploration emerges as the treatment of choice. Since November 1990, we have performed 59 laparoscopic common bile duct explorations. In our experience, the transcystic technique (18 patients) with choledochoscopy appears easier to perform than with fluoroscopy without choledochoscopy. Since, during our early experience, we encountered some difficulty with the transcystic technique, we elected to evaluate common duct exploration through a choledochotomy (41 patients). The main advantage of this technique is that it provides complete access to the ductal system without damage to the papilla. This procedure seems more difficult to perform than the transcystic technique and can be used when there are contraindications to the latter.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

CD010339|16382450|Balloon dilatation vs. balloon dilatation plus bile duct endoprostheses for treatment of anastomotic biliary strictures after liver transplantation.|Biliary strictures after liver transplantation are a therapeutic challenge for endoscopy. Anastomotic strictures occur in 10% of patients after liver transplantation, leading untreated to mortality and ultimately to graft failure. Despite of successful reports, to date, there is no defined endoscopic therapy regimen for these cases. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the most suitable concept for endoscopic treatment of post-liver transplant anastomotic strictures (PTAS). A total of 72 patients post-liver transplantation, who received endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) as a consequence of suspected biliary complications were retrospectively screened for the presence of PTAS. In all patients graft rejection or bile duct ischemia were excluded prior to ERC by liver biopsy or Doppler ultrasound respectively. We compared either balloon dilatation (BD) alone or dilatation plus placement of an increasing number of bile duct endoprostheses (BD + endoprostheses) in a retrospective analysis. A total of 25 of 75 patients showed PTAS. Overall, endoscopic therapy was successful in 22 of 25 patients (88%). BD was initially successful in 89% but showed recurrence in 62%. BD + endoprostheses was initially successful in 87%, and recurrence was observed only in 31%. All recurrences were successfully retreated by BD + endoprostheses. During 22 of 109 (20%) treatment sessions stone extraction was necessary. Complication rate was low with bacterial cholangitis in 8 of 109 (7.3%) sessions, mild pancreatitis in 10 of 109 (9%) sessions and minor bleeding in 2 of 25 (8%) sphincterotomies. Median follow-up after conclusion of endoscopic therapy is 6 months (range 1-43). In conclusion, our data confirm that endoscopic therapy of PTAS is highly effective and safe. As primarily successful BD shows a high rate of recurrence, we recommend a combination of BD followed by an increasing number and diameter of endoprostheses. Therapy sessions are effective at short intervals of every 2-3 months.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

This study was designed to evaluate: 1) the effectiveness of a recently available lithotripter (EDAP LT 01) for gallstone fragmentation; 2) adverse tissue reactions after treatment; 3) the optimum conditions for use of this apparatus in man. A human cholesterol stone was surgically implanted into the gallbladder of ten 20-25 kg mongrel dogs. One dog was used as a control. The other nine animals were divided into three groups (A, B and C). Two 60 min sessions of lithotripsy were carried out twice a week. Sonographic and CT examinations were performed 9 and 16 days after operation. The animals were killed 21 days after operation. Satisfactory fragmentation was obtained in 4 of the 9 animals, and in 2 dogs no stone fragments were detected. Fragments were found in the common bile duct in 5 dogs. In 2 animals a pathologic aspect of the papilla of Vater was observed. Marked hematoma was observed in the animals treated at 5 and 10 pulses/sec. In 5 cases, hematoma was observed in the gallbladder and in one case the gallbladder was ruptured. Hematoma was also noted in the hepatic vascular bed in 3 animals. Except for microscopic hemorrhagic lesions observed at the base of the right lung, no lesions were detected in any other organ. Shock waves produced by the EDAP LT 01 are effective for fragmentation of gallstones. However, in view of the tissue reactions observed at the higher pulse rates, the pulse rate should not exceed 2.5 pulses/s for use in man.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

A human cholesterol stone was surgically implanted into the gallbladder of ten 20-25 kg mongrel dogs. One dog was used as a control. The other nine animals were divided into three groups (A, B and C). Two 60 min sessions of lithotripsy were carried out twice a week. Sonographic and CT examinations were performed 9 and 16 days after operation. The animals were killed 21 days after operation. Satisfactory fragmentation was obtained in 4 of the 9 animals, and in 2 dogs no stone fragments were detected. Fragments were found in the common bile duct in 5 dogs. In 2 animals a pathologic aspect of the papilla of Vater was observed. Marked hematoma was observed in the animals treated at 5 and 10 pulses/sec. In 5 cases, hematoma was observed in the gallbladder and in one case the gallbladder was ruptured. Hematoma was also noted in the hepatic vascular bed in 3 animals. Except for microscopic hemorrhagic lesions observed at the base of the right lung, no lesions were detected in any other organ. Shock waves produced by the EDAP LT 01 are effective for fragmentation of gallstones. However, in view of the tissue reactions observed at the higher pulse rates, the pulse rate should not exceed 2.5 pulses/s for use in man.|0|Ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

As a route for the choledochoscopy, a T-tube tract, external cholecystostomy, or jejunal limb of hepaticojejunostomy was used in nine patients, while percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage followed by dilatation of the track was established in 31 patients. The largest cholesterol stone measured 55 mm by 33 mm and the largest bilirubinate stone measured 52 mm by 37 mm. The stones were disintegrated in all but one patient in whom choledochoscopic access to a gallstone was difficult due to deformity of the gallbladder. Complete removal of the stones was achieved in 38 of 39 patients. In a patient with hepatolithiasis, small stones located deep in inaccessible branches of the intrahepatic duct remained unremovable. There were no serious complication. Minor complications occurred, including bleeding from the bile duct mucosa in four patients and postprocedure chills and fever in three.

CD010339|758694|Cholelithiasis following subtotal gastric resection with truncal vagotomy.|Subtotal gastrectomy with bilateral truncal vagotomy is a good operation for peptic ulcer disease. Recurrence rates are low, and diarrhea and dumping are usually tolerable. The development of gallstones following this procedure, however, has become more problematic in that further opeation becomes a real necessity. In two groups of patients having undergone a standardized subtotal gastrectomy, with and without truncal vagotomy, only 6 per cent of the patients with resection alone had biliary calculi develop. This is consistent with the incidence of gallstone formation in the normal population. However, in the group undergoing resection with bilateral vagotomy, 21 per cent had gallstones develop which were detected by ultrasonography or oral cholecystography and confirmed at operation. This suggests that cholelithiasis following truncal vagotomy is a long term complication which must be recognized and, unless otherwise indicated, requires an additional surgical procedure. Only when results of long term follow-up studies verify the therapeutic effectiveness of such operations as highly selective or parietal cell vagotomy without drainage will a more physiologically sound operation be within our grasp.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

However, several complications associated with spillage of gallstones have been reported recently. Most of these complications presented late after the original procedure, many with clinical pictures not related to biliary etiology, confounding and delaying adequate management. For patients presenting with intraabdominal or thoracic abscesses of unknown etiology, if there is a history of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, regardless of the time interval, certain evaluations should be considered. A sonogram and a CT scan are advisable to detect retained extraluminal gallstones, as most patients will require, not only drainage of fluid collections, but also removal of the stones. A case is described of a patient who presented with a right empyema and transdiaphragmatic abscess 18 months after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

CD010339|2757504|Biliary lithotripsy. Determination of stone fragmentation success and potential tissue injury in swine.|Application of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy to gallbladder stones was studied in 37 adult female swine. Twenty-two sows underwent cholecystostomy with implantation of human gallstones. In 20 animals, after a 10-day recovery period, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, 2000 shocks (an amount determined in preliminary water bath studies to be effective), was performed. In 10 of these implanted swine, frequent focal point refocusing and biplanar ultrasonography were employed. Two animals served as operative controls. Fifteen other animals without gallstone implantation were studied for adverse effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy on tissue. These animals (unimplanted) received 5000 shocks; 7 animals were killed 1 to 4 days after treatment and the others were killed after 4 weeks. Biochemical tests (total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lipase, amylase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase determinations) were performed on all animals at entry and every second or third day until they were killed. Successful fragmentation, defined as all residual gallstone fragments being less than or equal to 4 mm in greatest dimension, was achieved in 14 of 20 animals overall, but in 10 of 10 animals in which focal point refocusing had been used. Slight perivascular hemorrhage and minimal coagulation necrosis were seen histologically only in the liver parenchyma adjacent to the gallbladder bed. The remainder of the liver was grossly and histologically normal. No injuries to the colon, duodenum, common bile duct, or pancreas were observed. No alterations suggesting injury or altered function occurred in any of the biochemical tests.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|3377328|Biliary stone extraction.|This report summarizes a 14-year experience with 219 patients referred for sinus tract extraction of retained common duct stones. The patients ranged from 18 to 94 years of age and 60 per cent were women. Forty seven per cent of patients were seen within 6 weeks postoperatively and 79 per cent within 3 months of surgery. Sixty four per cent of patients had a single stone; the remainder had multiple stones, sludge or ductal debris. Sinus tract manipulation under fluoroscopic control was done using a variety of baskets, catheters and instruments, including endoscopy, along with pre- and post-manipulation intravenous antibiotics. Routine testing and cultures are done and useful when clinical biliary sepsis occurs (1%). Meticulous postextraction cholangiography has contributed to our success and is an important part of the procedure, usually done 24 hours after the last manipulation. Successful extraction occurred during a single session in 125 of 219 patients (57%); 60 of 219 patients required two extraction sessions. Four patients spontaneously passed stones. The remaining patients required three to seven sessions before the extraction was considered complete. Successful extraction of all stones and debris from patients' biliary ducts occurred in 210 of 219 cases (96%). Five of the nine failures occurred in the first one hundred patients (1974-1979) and all required reoperation. Failure occurred in four of the last one hundred patients (1979-1986) and all were successfully treated by ERCP extraction. Two deaths occurred very early in our series and were related to advanced biliary sepsis at the time of the initial presentation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|2818337|Treatment of postcholedochoduodenostomy symptoms.|Upper abdominal symptoms after side-to-side choledochoduodenostomy (CDDY) may be attributed to stagnant bile, food and calculi pooling in the distal bile duct 'sump' with resultant biliary or pancreatic duct obstruction and sepsis. Endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) provides a means of draining this sump. The aim of this study was to assess outcome following endoscopic retrograde choledochopancreatography (ERCP) and ES in patients with post-CDDY symptoms. Eight such patients (M: F = 1:7) underwent ERCP between September 1981 and March 1987. Their median age was 60 years (range: 37-72 years) and the median period since CDDY was 11 years (range: 1-28 years). The median follow-up after ERCP was 18 months (range: 14-94 months). Presenting symptoms comprised postprandial (one) or intermittent (seven) abdominal pain, cholangitis (three), pancreatitis (one) and jaundice (one). ERCP revealed bile duct abnormalities in four, consisting of filling defects alone (two), anastomotic narrowing with filling defects (one) and sclerosing cholangitis. ES was performed in seven, of whom three (all with filling defects at ERCP) remain asymptomatic and three are significantly improved. One had recurrent pancreatitis for which a sphincteroplasty and pancreatic duct septectomy was performed. ES was not performed in one because of technical difficulties (there being no subsequent improvement). It is concluded that, in patients with post-CDDY biliary symptoms, endoscopic sphincterotomy relieves the symptoms by either producing drainage of the sump at the distal bile duct, or dividing a dysfunctioning sphincter of Oddi.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|12640158|Papillary neoplasms of the bile duct that mimic biliary stone disease.|Papillary tumors of the bile duct are intraductal tumors with innumerable minute, frondlike papillary projections. These tumors may be either fixed to or detached from the bile duct wall. However, because the papillary projections on the surface of papillary tumors are long and slender, the tumors are friable and slough easily. The sloughed tumor fragments may float within the bile ducts, resulting in intermittent partial biliary obstruction and mimicking bile duct stones at clinical examination and at ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and cholangiography. A tumor manifests radiologically as thickening and irregularity of the bile duct wall or as a fixed or sloughed intraductal mass. A nonshadowing intraductal echogenic cast seen at US, an intraductal noncalcified soft-tissue mass with asymmetric wall thickening seen at CT, and an intraductal mass with a papillary surface and a serrated bile duct margin seen at cholangiography are all appearances that suggest a papillary tumor and may be helpful in differentiating a tumor from a bile duct stone.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

About 10-20% of patients with gallbladder stones may also present associated common bile duct stones. The management of the latter remains controversial because many different surgical strategies are available: laparoscopic treatment (laparoscopic common bile duct exploration), sequential endoscopic and laparoscopic treatment (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography/endoscopic sphincterotomy [ERCP/ES] prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy), inverted sequential endoscopic-laparoscopic treatment (laparoscopic cholecystectomy followed by ERCP/ES), and combined endoscopic-laparoscopic treatment (laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative ERCP/ES). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential endoscopic-laparoscopic treatment in patients with cholecystocholedocholithiasis. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical, biochemical and radiological features of 552 patients operated on for cholelithiasis from 1991 to 2001. Common bile duct stones were suspected on the basis of increased serum levels of bilirubin, GOT, GPT, GGT, alkaline phosphatase; presence of jaundice; history of pancreatitis or cholangitis; dilated common bile duct (diameter > 8 mm) or common bile duct stones at hepatobiliary ultrasonography; presence of common bile duct stones at MR-cholangiography or at i.v. cholangiography. In patients with suspected common bile duct stones, preoperative ERCP was performed; if common bile duct stones were confirmed, ES was performed. When common bile duct stones were not suspected preoperatively, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed directly. Overall morbidity, mortality and conversion rates in the two groups were evaluated. Of 552 patients admitted for cholelithiasis, 62 (11.3%) underwent preoperative ERCP for suspected common bile duct stones. In 41 patients (66.1%) common bile duct stones were identified and ES with common bile duct stone extraction was performed in 40 patients (clearance: 97.5%). The overall morbidity was 16% (10 cases of post-ERCP acute pancreatitis); no mortality occurred. The conversion rate during subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 4.8%. In the group of patients with no suspicion of common bile duct stones, the conversion rate was 4.9%. Sequential treatment cannot be considered the best approach for patients with cholecystocholedocholithiasis because of its morbidity rate and the high rate of negative preoperative ERCP findings. Combined endoscopic-laparoscopic treatment seems to present more advantages, especially in term of morbidity, hospital stay and patient compliance and may, in future, be considered the treatment of choice for patients with cholecystocholedocholithiasis.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

He attributed his weight loss to poor appetite due to persistent nausea. He had no significant past medical history apart from moderate mitral regurgitation and recent cholecystectomy. He felt some of these symptoms began after laparoscopic cholecystectomy 12 months before. The procedure had been complicated by a self-limiting biliary leak. He had been recently evaluated by chest physicians and gastroenterologists for clubbing and weight loss.

CD010339|10022655|An extrahepatic bile duct metastasis from a gallbladder cancer mimicking Mirizzi's syndrome.|We report a case of an extrahepatic bile duct metastasis from a gallbladder cancer that mimicked Mirizzi's syndrome on cholangiography. A 67-yr-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis. As obstructive jaundice developed after the admission, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was performed to ameliorate the jaundice and to evaluate the biliary system. Tube cholangiography revealed bile duct obstruction at the hepatic hilus, and extrinsic compression of the lateral aspect of the common hepatic duct, with nonvisualization of the gallbladder. No impacted cystic duct stone was visualized on CT or ultrasonography. Laparotomy revealed a gallbladder tumor as well as an extrahepatic bile duct tumor. We diagnosed that the latter was a metastasis from the gallbladder cancer, based on the histopathological features. This case is unique in that the extrahepatic bile duct metastasis obstructed both the common hepatic duct and the cystic duct, giving the appearance of Mirizzi's syndrome on cholangiography. Metastatic bile duct tumors that mimic Mirizzi's syndrome have not been previously reported. The presence of this condition should be suspected in patients with the cholangiographic features of Mirizzi's syndrome, when the CT or ultrasonographic findings fail to demonstrate an impacted cystic duct stone.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|6745615|Intermittency of cholesterol crystals in duodenal bile from gallstone patients.|The detection of cholesterol crystals in duodenal bile is of clinical value in the diagnosis of cholesterol gallstone disease; however, not all patients with cholesterol gallstones have crystals detected in their duodenal bile, thus limiting the value of examination of duodenal bile. The aims of this study were to (i) determine whether the lack of crystals in some patients with cholesterol gallstones was due to (a) the intermittent presence of crystals, (b) spontaneous crystal dissolution, or (c) changes in dietary cholesterol intake; (ii) determine whether incubation of duodenal bile for 24 h would result in crystal formation. Sixteen patients with radiolucent gallstones each underwent three duodenal biliary drainages. Thirty-one percent of patients had crystals in all three bile specimens, 12% in two specimens, 25% in one specimen, and 32% in no specimen. One of 31 specimens with small numbers of crystals initially had no crystals at 24 h, and five specimens initially devoid of crystals developed crystals by 24 h. Despite a significant increase in biliary cholesterol saturation index with increasing cholesterol intake, the prevalence of crystals in bile did not increase in gallstone patients. No crystals were identified in 18 specimens from normal subjects examined initially or in the 15 specimens that were examined after 24 h. We conclude that the intermittent presence of cholesterol crystals in duodenal bile is probably not due to dissolution of crystals or varying dietary cholesterol intake and that the frequency with which crystals are found increases with incubation. Determination of the diagnostic value of multiple duodenal biliary drainages or incubation of bile in patients with normal oral cholecystograms or gallbladder ultrasonograms, however, will require examinations of large numbers of patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The results showed that during 1985-1986 the sensitivity of ultrasonography (US) to detect stones in gallbladder (GB), extrahepatic bile duct (EHD) and intrahepatic bile duct (IHD) was 98.4%, 68.2% and 82.4% respectively, each was much higher than its counterpart during the periods 1981-1982 and 1983-1984 (P less than 0.01). The specificity of US in detecting GB, EHD and IHD stones was all over 90% during the latter two years. The observations made in the present study suggest that the accuracy of US has risen so significantly that it should be used as the first modality in diagnosing cholelithiasis, particularly cholecystolithiasis.

The results showed that during 1985-1986 the sensitivity of ultrasonography (US) to detect stones in gallbladder (GB), extrahepatic bile duct (EHD) and intrahepatic bile duct (IHD) was 98.4%, 68.2% and 82.4% respectively, each was much higher than its counterpart during the periods 1981-1982 and 1983-1984 (P less than 0.01). The specificity of US in detecting GB, EHD and IHD stones was all over 90% during the latter two years. The observations made in the present study suggest that the accuracy of US has risen so significantly that it should be used as the first modality in diagnosing cholelithiasis, particularly cholecystolithiasis. It, however, should be supplemented with such tests as oral cholecystography, intravenous cholangiography, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to establish a correct diagnosis when its interpretation is equivocal.|1|Ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Sixteen mongrel dogs had laparotomy and ligation of distal CBD; 1 week to 10 days later, 0-3 gallstones of varying sizes (2-5 mm) were introduced into the dilated CBD (6-16 mm). High-resolution intraoperative ultrasonography of the CBD and a conventional intraoperative cholangiogram were performed to detect the presence and number of stones. The results of these two tests were evaluated independently by two ultrasonographers and two surgeons. There were 21 true-positive and five false-negative readings by sonogram compared with 17 and 9, respectively, by cholangiogram. Sensitivity of the sonogram was 81% and 65.4% by cholangiogram. Score of accuracy was 1.06 and 1.62 by cholangiogram and 0.81 and 0.87 by ultrasound (p less than 0.05).

The accuracy of HIDA was 92% in acute and 78% in chronic cholecystitis. Intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) done in 173 patients indicated the need for exploratory choledochotomy in 24; 21 had choledocholithiasis. These observations suggest that OCG and US are very accurate, but not infallible, in detecting cholelithiasis. US should be done first; when doubt persists, the addition of OCG allows the preoperative diagnosis of gallstones in 97% of the cases. HIDA is highly accurate but not infallible in detecting acute calculous cholecystitis.

A convenience sample of patients with suspected gallbladder disease received a focused RUQ ultrasound by an EP. Sonographic findings, number of previous RUQ ultrasounds performed, and time for examination completion were recorded. Each patient then had a formal RUQ ultrasound by a sonographer blinded to the focused RUQ ultrasound results. Focused RUQ and formal ultrasound findings were compared, with the exception of the sonographic Murphy sign, which was compared to pathology reports. One hundred nine patients were enrolled. Fifty-one had gallstones. Forty-nine were detected by EPs, yielding a sensitivity of 96% [95% confidence interval (CI).87-.99]. Of the 58 patients without gallstones, 51 were correctly diagnosed by EPs (specificity = 88%, 95% CI.77-.95). The sonographic Murphy sign was present during 54 emergency examinations, but in only 24 formal studies. When compared to pathology reports, the emergency sonographic Murphy sign had a sensitivity of 75% compared to the formal ultrasound sensitivity of 45% for acute cholecystitis. EPs were less accurate for other sonographic findings, and level of experience had little effect on sensitivity or specificity for detecting gallstones.

CD010339|2634700|Gall bladder disease: an analytical report of 250 cases.|Two hundred and fifty cases of biliary tract disease were studied as regards case history, physical and laboratory investigations, surgery and follow-up. It was found that females especially multipara were frequently affected; majority of cases were in 3rd to 5th decade of their life, rise in age showing decline in incidence. Majority of cases (82.4%) were vegetarians and had used vegetable fats (oriental diet). Most of the cases (98.8%) belonged to middle and poor class and were lean and thin. Pain in the right upper quadrant of the anterior abdominal wall had been the commonest symptom, in about half the cases it got aggravated by fatty meals. A mass was felt in the right hypochondrium in 29.6% and Murphy's sign was positive in 55.5% of cases. Radio-opaque calculi were present in 8% of cases, in another 10.8% the calculi were demonstrated by oral cholecystography, radiography could detect calculi in 47 (25.4%) cases and its overall diagnostic success rate has been low (56.8%). Ultrasonography proved more valuable tool for diagnosis; bile culture was positive in 8.8% of cases only for Esch coli, proteus, klebsiella, staphylococci or paracolon. Right subcostal incision gave the best results. Chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis (74%) was more common than acalculus cholecystitis (26%), incidence of carcinoma was 2.8%, and in 5 out of 7 cases malignancy was associated with cholelithiasis. Early diagnosis and cholecystectomy for gallstones can prevent malignancy. Surgery on the whole proved beneficial and it can be more rewarding if pre-operatively other causes of dyspepsia are either excluded or confirmed. Excluding cases of malignancy, the mortality has been quite low and thus acceptable.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

A mass was felt in the right hypochondrium in 29.6% and Murphy's sign was positive in 55.5% of cases. Radio-opaque calculi were present in 8% of cases, in another 10.8% the calculi were demonstrated by oral cholecystography, radiography could detect calculi in 47 (25.4%) cases and its overall diagnostic success rate has been low (56.8%). Ultrasonography proved more valuable tool for diagnosis; bile culture was positive in 8.8% of cases only for Esch coli, proteus, klebsiella, staphylococci or paracolon. Right subcostal incision gave the best results. Chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis (74%) was more common than acalculus cholecystitis (26%), incidence of carcinoma was 2.8%, and in 5 out of 7 cases malignancy was associated with cholelithiasis. Early diagnosis and cholecystectomy for gallstones can prevent malignancy. Surgery on the whole proved beneficial and it can be more rewarding if pre-operatively other causes of dyspepsia are either excluded or confirmed. Excluding cases of malignancy, the mortality has been quite low and thus acceptable.|0|Ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|10672405|Haemorrhage into non-functioning adrenal cysts--report of two cases and review of the literature.|Adrenal cysts are a rare condition and are usually non-functioning and asymptomatic. Most of the reported cases were incidental findings or discovered at autopsy. However, large cysts have a tendency to develop complications such as intracystic haemorrhage and rupture, which can present as an acute surgical emergency. We report two cases of adrenal cysts with intracystic haemorrhage. One patient presented with persistent non-specific upper abdominal pain, investigations with ultrasound (US) scan and computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a left adrenal cyst and gallstones. Simultaneous cholecystectomy and adrenalectomy was performed with resultant relief of symptoms. The second patient presented with acute abdominal pain simulating acute surgical abdomen. Preoperative CT scan showed a large cystic lesion in the region of the tail of the pancreas with radiological evidence of haemorrhage but was unable to confirm its origin. The cyst was found to have arisen from the left adrenal gland at laparotomy; left adrenalectomy with complete excision of the cyst was done. Histology showed pseudocyst with haemorrhage in both cases. Pseudocyst is the commonest histological type encountered clinically. We believe the second case is related to pregnancy and childbirth as the patient presented during puerperium and the cyst, even though very large in size (25 x 15 x 15 cm), was not noted during antenatal screening with US scan.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Plain abdominal X-ray performed on emergency showed marked small bowel distention, and air-fluid levels suggestive of intestinal obstruction. CT was indicated to establish its precise site and cause. The presence of a gallstone was evidenced: gallstone ileus was diagnosed. Interestingly enough, at surgery the gallstone was not found; most likely it was expelled spontaneuously during the time elapsed between CT and surgery.

CD009323|7992153|Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Do preoperative factors predict the need to convert to open?|We reviewed our experience with the last 587 laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed between May 1990 and January 1993 to correlate preoperative findings that may predict the conversion of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to that of an open procedure. The prediction of a need to convert to an open cholecystectomy would allow the surgeon to discuss the higher risk of conversion with the patient and also allow for an earlier intraoperative decision to convert if difficulty was encountered. In addition to routine demographic data, ultrasound reports were available for 526 patients and the following information was recorded: presence of stones, thickened gallbladder wall, common bile duct dilatation, gallbladder sludge, and cystic duct impaction. Overall, a two times higher rate of conversion was found for male patients and patients with a body mass index > 27.2 kg/m2. Additionally, a thickened gallbladder wall on preoperative ultrasound was correlated with a six times higher conversion rate to open cholecystectomy. As expected, the positive intraoperative cholangiogram was associated with a higher incidence of conversion. Additionally, finding a dilated common bile duct on ultrasound was found to be associated with a nearly seven times higher rate of positive intraoperative cholangiogram. No statistical significance was found between conversion and age, previous abdominal operations, the presence of stones, common bile duct dilatation, gallbladder sludge, cystic duct impaction, or a distended gallbladder. Thus, these predictive findings allow the surgeon to preoperatively discuss the higher risk of conversion and allow for an earlier judgment decision to convert if intraoperative difficulty is encountered.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

CD010339|3435322|Methyl tertiary butyl ether cholelitholysis of calculi in the gallbladder and bile ducts.|Recent use of the cholelitholytic agent, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) has demonstrated its efficacy in the dissolution of cholesterol calculi. In three patients with retained stones in the bile duct, MTBE was instilled and aspirated through a T tube to effect dissolution. Stones dissolved completely in two patients, while in the third, partial dissolution permitted instrumental extraction through the T tube tract. In this third patient, dissolution of gallbladder stones in vitro was relatively slow. Patients tolerated the procedure well and there were no major complications. There was no evidence of duodenal inflammation in two patients who underwent duodenoscopy and biopsy before and after treatment. Four patients with cholesterol cholelithiasis underwent direct gallbladder perfusion with MTBE. The mean size of the gallstones was 0.8 cm (range 0.25-1.75 cm) and the mean number of stones per patient was four (range 1-13 stones). MTBE was instilled via a percutaneous gallbladder catheter inserted under local anesthesia with X-ray control. In three patients, the stone dissolution appeared to be complete after three to six hours of treatment. In the fourth patient, catheter displacement led to termination of dissolution therapy. Follow-up ultrasonograms in two patients demonstrated residual debris not visualised on the immediate post-dissolution films. Complications occurred in two patients and included catheter dislodgement and bile leakage after catheter withdrawal. Biliary perfusion with MTBE is a therapeutic option in patients with retained stones in whom instrumental retrieval has failed. It may also have a role in selected patients with symptomatic stones in the gallbladder.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|8840458|Laparoscopic choledochoduodenostomy.|Choledochoduodenostomy is less often performed since the advent of ERCP and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES). It may, however, still prove necessary in patients where ERCP and ES fail to provide long-term biliary drainage or when CBD stones recur after ES. We have performed laparoscopic choledochoduodenostomy in two patients (aged 66 and 71 years). Surgery was performed in one patient for recurrent CBD stones 25 years after cholecystectomy where three attempts at ERCP failed to cannulate the CBD. In the second patient it was performed for recurrent CBD stones 16 years after cholecystectomy and after two previous endoscopic sphincterotomies. Surgery was completed in just over 3 h in both cases and postoperative stay was 4 days. Laparoscopic choledochoduodenostomy is a viable technique which may prove valuable in the management of patients in whom ERCP and ES has failed to provide long-term biliary drainage.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7114606|Operative cholangiomanometry as a guide to common duct exploration.|A trial of operative cholangiomanometry was proposed as a guide to common duct exploration to see if this technique would help in reducing the incidence of unnecessary common bile duct explorations and the incidence of retained stones. The technique for operative cholangiomanometry as modified from White is described. This method was used in 21 patients. A very close correlation between manometry and cholangiography in predicting the presence of pathology within the common duct at the time of extrahepatic biliary surgery was shown. Flow was the most accurate diagnostic parameter. Seven patients who were found to have common duct stones had both abnormal manometry and cholangiography. Fourteen patients without stones included 12 with negative cholangiography and manometry, and two in which manometry was normal but cholangiography suggested pathology. Common duct manometry and cholangiography can be used to decrease the number of unnecessary common duct explorations and the incidence of retained stones. The theory that common duct pathology will increase pressure and decrease flow rates is supported by this study. Manometry and cholangiography should be used in combination as they are additive studies.

CD010339|10235361|Undiagnosed Mirizzi's syndrome: a word of caution for laparoscopic surgeons--a report of three cases and review of the literature.|The Mirizzi syndrome is often undiagnosed before surgery and can carry a high risk of iatrogenic damage to the common bile duct when encountered during open or, especially, laparoscopic surgery. Endoscopic management has recently been reported, but this treatment can be performed only when there is a high index of suspicion based on clinical criteria that the condition is present and therefore suggests the indication for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This is not always the case. Consequently, in a considerable percentage of patients, the syndrome is discovered only after the bile ducts have been damaged during surgery. Three cases of Mirizzi's syndrome were observed in our experience of 896 laparoscopic cholecystectomies (0.3%). All patients were without typical symptoms, and the syndrome was unsuspected in spite of preoperative intravenous cholangiography. All patients required conversion to an open procedure, with two injuries of the common bile duct (a complete transection and a tear) being promptly repaired. We conclude that when this syndrome is suspected or found during surgery, the surgeon should follow these guidelines: (1) perform intraoperative cholangiography when possible, even through the gallbladder wall; and (2) dissect the gallbladder from above and, if necessary, open it to extract the stone. Dissection of Calot's triangle should never be attempted. Great expertise is required to complete the operation laparoscopically. The reported cases in the literature refer to a high percentage of conversion, underlining the technical difficulties and making this syndrome, when undiagnosed and unsuspected, a real challenge for laparoscopic surgeons.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

A prospective study.|In a prospective trial to determine whether gastric surgery induces gallbladder sludge and stone formation, 48 patients with gastric cancer were ultrasonographically examined with simultaneous observation on changes in gallbladder contractile function before and serially for 5 years after gastrectomy. Gallbladder sludge formation was induced with a high frequency of 42% 1 month after gastrectomy, with corresponding significant lowering of gallbladder contractile function. Most of gallbladder sludges, however, disappeared within 12 months in relation to the gradual recovery of gallbladder contractile function. Conversely, gallstone developed in nine patients (18.8%), mostly more than 6 months after gastrectomy. Interestingly, gallstone formation was induced in seven patients who were sludge negative. An evolvement of gallbladder sludge into stone was observed in only two patients, who were, however, treated with intravenous hyperalimentation. This study first provides evidence for the relationship between gastrectomy and a considerably high frequency of incidence of gallbladder sludge and stone in relation to changes in gallbladder kinetics after gastrectomy.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7255722|Ultrasonic evaluation of patients with acute right upper quadrant pain.|To define the role of ultrasound in evaluating acute right upper quadrant pain, a prospective study was performed on 52 patients having clinically suspected acute cholecystitis. Ultrasonographic determination of acute or chronic cholecystitis, or diagnosis of a normal gallbladder, was based on analysis of location of tenderness, calculi, sludge, and wall thickness. The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (34.6% of patients) was based on the highly significant observations of focal gallbladder tenderness and calculi. Sludge and wall thickening were also statistically significant, but to a lesser degree. Cholelithiasis allowed differentiation of patients with chronic cholecystitis (32.7%) from patients with normal gallbladders (32.7%). Neither of these two groups had significant focal gallbladder tenderness, sludge, or thickened walls. Because acute cholecystitis is found in the minority of patients with acute right upper quadrant pain, and because ultrasound is rapid, accurate, and noninvasive, it should be the initial modality used to evaluate these patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Tokyo Cooperative Gallstone Study Group.|The cholelitholytic action of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was investigated by a double-blind clinical trial. The trial started with 151 subjects all confirmed by radiographic examination as having radiolucent gallstones in a functioning gallbladder. The subjects were divided into three groups receiving 600 mg/day of UDCA, 150 mg/day of UDCA, and placebo (lactose) per day, respectively. Seventy-nine cases were classed as dropouts or were excluded due to incomplete follow-up or inadequate patient selection, and the data on the remaining 72 cases were analyzed. After 6--12 mo of treatment, dissolution of decrease in size or number of stones occurred in 10 of the 29 cases in the 600 mg/day group (34.5%), 4 of 23 cases in the 150 mg/day group (17.4%), and 1 of 20 cases in the control group (5.0%). For those cases with noncalcified, less than 15 mm in diameter, and floating stones, efficacy increased to 83.3% in the 600 mg/day group. Lithogenic index of bile defined by Thomas and Hofmann became unsaturated after treatment in the 600 mg/day group. Neither diarrhea nor hepatic toxicity was noted.

CD010339|9428581|High prevalence of cholelithiasis in a low income Mexican population: an ultrasonographic survey.|The authors present the results of a population-based survey of cholelithiasis carried out in a low-income area of Mexico City using high-resolution gallbladder ultrasound. The purpose of the study was to estimate the prevalence and selected associated risk factors of cholelithiasis (CL). The population of the studied area was 15,532 subjects, of whom 3,505 (22.6%) were eligible for the baseline survey (men and non-pregnant women between 35-64 years of age). Of this group, 1,735 (76.03%, 702 men and 1,033 women) were located for a follow-up study. Ultrasonography was performed on all except for 100 subjects who had undergone previous cholecystectomy. Crude prevalence of CL was 14.1% (95% CI 12.5-15.5). The prevalence was 5.8% (95% CI 4.1-7.5) in men and 19.7% (95% CI 17.3-22.1) in women. Presence of gallstones was associated with age, sex (men p<0.006, women p<0.001), and multiparity (p<0.002). Centrality index in men and body mass index in women were positive and significantly associated with CL when compared with subjects without CL. High levels of fasting and post-glucose load insulin in women and men respectively were associated with CL. The authors conclude that the population of this study has a high prevalence of CL and confirm some known risk factors such as age, sex, BMI and multiparity. Proper assessment of the magnitude problem and characterization of potentially modifiable risk factors will play a major role in preventing this pathology.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The study included 52 patients having either cholecystocholangiography or cystic duct cholangiography. In 13 out of 26 patients (50%) cholecystocholangiography failed because of obstruction of the cystic duct.

CD011549|11193492|[The significance of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in acute cholecystitis].|To clarify the significance of magnetic renonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in the acute phase of acute cholecystitis, MRCP was carried out in forty-five patients with acute cholecystitis in their acute phase. The MR pericholecystic high signal was observed in 38 of the 45 patients (84%). Enlargement of the gallbladder, presence of gallstones, and impacted stones was seen in 71%, 53%, and 18%, respectively. The MR pericholecystic high signal was classified into four categories: type 0, not observed; type 1, a liner high signal; type 2, a band-like high signal; type 3, a radiating high signal. In patients who showed a type 3 MR pericholecystic high signal, 91% required percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage, and most of the gallbladders were diagnosed as necrotic cholecystitis by histology. The accuracy of MRCP for the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis was 96%.

CD010339|8211854|[Radiologic and ultrasound detection of gallstones].|Ultrasonography (US) is the method of choice for evaluation of gallbladder stones with an accuracy of 96%. Number, size and calcification can be assessed by virtue of US reflection and attenuation. If more than five stones are present, the accuracy decreases. To determine the calcium content of stones more precisely, computed tomography can be used. This allows an assessment of the success rate of lithotripsy and chemolysis. Oral cholecystography is an alternative method of similar accuracy as US. It provides additional information about the patency of the cystic duct. In the presence of ductal stones, the accuracy of US decreases to 30%, mainly because of overlying bowel gas. Since 8 to 16% of all cases of cholecystolithiasis are accompanied by choledocholithiasis and since this entails a change in treatment, intravenous cholecystocholangiography with an accuracy of more than 90% is the method of choice in this case. Additionally, it provides knowledge on the biliary anatomy preoperatively. It does not, however, replace US, because opacification of the gallbladder is limited with this method. If intravenous cholecystocholangiography fails in case of impaired liver function, transcholecystic cholangiography or, in cases of dilated ducts, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography can be used.

Some studies have found impaired emptying of the gallbladder in cirrhotic patients. Our aim here was to investigate gallbladder emptying in cirrhotic patients with and without gallstones to find out whether emptying is further impaired in the presence of gallstones. The study group comprised 24 patients with liver cirrhosis and gallstones, 8 in each Child class. The controls were represented by 18 cirrhotic patients without gallstones, 6 in each Child class. Fasting gallbladder volume was calculated by ultrasound using the ellipsoid formula. Gallbladder emptying was evaluated for 90 min after ingestion of a solid-liquid meal (14 g fat, 425 kcal), by assessing minimal residual volume, gallbladder ejection fraction, and area under emptying curve at 15-min intervals. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed Students' t test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. In controls, gallbladder fasting and residual volumes increased with the severity of cirrhosis, but gallbladder emptying did not change significantly. In cirrhotics with gallstones, gallbladder emptying decreased in Child C compared with Child A class patients and, also, compared to Child C controls. The number or size of gallstones, as well as the thickness of the gallbladder wall, did not correlate with gallbladder emptying parameters. Gallbladder contractility is impaired in patients with liver cirrhosis and gallstones. Hypomotility is proportional to the severity of liver disease.

The aim of the present study was to investigate factors related to disturbances in gallbladder emptying measured by ultrasound. Detailed information about weight loss attempts, age at onset of obesity, parity, presence of menopause, use of contraceptive or hormonal replacement drugs, and phase of menstrual cycle was obtained. Smoking habits, alcohol use, dietary intake, and physical activity were recorded. Body composition and fat distribution were assessed by anthropometry. Blood samples were taken for CCK, lipids, glucose, and insulin. Mean (SD) fasting gallbladder volume was 30.0 (12.6) ml. The residual volume was 12.5 (9.8) ml 90 min after a test meal. CCK levels increased from a basal 1.64 (0.8) pM to a peak value of 2.9 (1.0) pM. Fasting gallbladder volumes were closely related to residual and ejection volumes. Body weight and fasting insulin levels explained 35.2% of the variance in fasting volume, lean body mass and insulin explained 28.1% of the residual volume, and waist circumference 23.6% of the ejection volume. None of the other factors were related to gallbladder emptying. Subjects with the largest fasting gallbladders had the largest residual and least emptying gallbladders, scored the highest in every aspect of body size, composition, and fat distribution, and also had the highest insulin levels.

Smoking habits, alcohol use, dietary intake, and physical activity were recorded. Body composition and fat distribution were assessed by anthropometry. Blood samples were taken for CCK, lipids, glucose, and insulin. Mean (SD) fasting gallbladder volume was 30.0 (12.6) ml. The residual volume was 12.5 (9.8) ml 90 min after a test meal. CCK levels increased from a basal 1.64 (0.8) pM to a peak value of 2.9 (1.0) pM. Fasting gallbladder volumes were closely related to residual and ejection volumes. Body weight and fasting insulin levels explained 35.2% of the variance in fasting volume, lean body mass and insulin explained 28.1% of the residual volume, and waist circumference 23.6% of the ejection volume. None of the other factors were related to gallbladder emptying. Subjects with the largest fasting gallbladders had the largest residual and least emptying gallbladders, scored the highest in every aspect of body size, composition, and fat distribution, and also had the highest insulin levels. Body weight, lean body mass, central fat distribution, and insulin levels were the main determinants of gallbladder kinetics. Fasting and residual gallbladder volumes were closely related and both determined by obesity and its metabolic complication of hyperinsulinemia.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones

Most cases are caused mainly by iatrogenic injury and trauma, and are usually located in the sub-hepatic space. Spontaneous biloma is an uncommon entity. We report three rare cases of spontaneous hepatic subcapsular biloma formation in association with choledocholithiasis in two patients and cholangiocarcinoma in one patient. All the patients presented with extrahepatic biliary obstruction with no previous history of abdominal surgery, instrumentation, or trauma. Ultrasound and computerized tomography of the abdomen documented hepatic subcapsular biloma. The patients were initially managed with antibiotics and radiologically guided pigtail drainage of the collections, followed by definitive treatment of their underlying cause.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Early detection, T and N staging and Fine Needle Aspiration plus cithologic confirmation, are some of the expected benefits. Exclusion of benign findings like choledocholithiasis or chronic pancreatitis is also important. A correct understanding of the complex ampullary and periampullary anatomy is needed. Knowledge of the individual clinical history and other previous diagnostic images all contribute to a successful EUS examination. Radial and lineal EUS images are uniquely detailed and, at the moment, it seems to be the best way to exclude or confirm malignant or benign findings. We propose a procedural algorithm, including EUS, for suspected ampullary or periampullary tumors. This review summarizes the vast amount of information to be found spread in the literature, and recognizes this small anatomic area as the origin for a clinical entity with proper clinical presentation, proper imaging and proper therapeutic resolutions.

CD010339|10626165|A case of complex hepatolithiasis successfully treated with a systematic approach.|A systematic approach is required to treat complex hepatolithiasis. A 45 year-old female patient with hepatolithiasis had bilateral intrahepatic stones, biliary strictures at the right hepatic duct and segment IV duct, cholangitic abscess, and shrinkage of the right hepatic lobe. Six sessions of lithotomy were carried out under the guidance of percutaneous transhepatic choledochoscopy using a dye-laser lithotriptor through the segment III duct. Although stones were eradicated from the common bile duct and segment III duct, stones remained in other segments where cholangioscopic access was not feasible. Biliary bilirubin concentration increased and the liver abscess was resolved. Thereafter, the patient underwent right hepatectomy and choledochojejunostomy. After surgery, percutaneous transhepatic cholangio-drainage and balloon dilatation of the segment IV duct was performed. The patient underwent 11 more sessions of cholangioscopic lithotomy through 2 transhepatic routes and the bilioenteric bypass. Thereafter, the patient became almost stone-free. After discharge, biliary tracts were irrigated with saline through a subcutaneously placed reservoir. The patient is alive and well and had been without stone recurrence for 3 years. This report shows the efficacy of the vigorous combination therapy, including repeated cholangioscopic lithotomy through multiple routes using laser lithotripsy, surgery, and long-term biliary irrigation.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|11180878|Rapid intravenous administration of amino acids prevents biliary sludge induced by total parenteral nutrition in humans.|The aim of this study was to evaluate whether daily rapid intravenous administration of amino acids (IVAA) prevented the formation of biliary sludge in humans receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Thirty adult patients receiving TPN for more than 28 consecutive days were studied. They were randomized to receive either saline solution (placebo) intravenously (15 patients) or 6.9% branched chain amino acid (BCAA)-enriched amino acid (15 synthetic amino acids; Freamine HBC) solution given by administration rapid intravenous (15 patients). The groups were similar with respect to age, sex, diagnosis, liver function test results, amylase levels, TPN time, and time of study. All patients underwent weekly ultrasound studies. Volume and emptying studies of the gallbladder in response to the study drug were performed after 1 week. As a result, none of the patients receiving rapid IVAA had sludge, whereas 11 of the 15 patients receiving placebo had sludge (P < 0.01). Results of emptying studies showed significant contraction of the gallbladder in those in the rapid IVAA group, but not in the placebo group. Consequently, the data suggest that rapid IVAA given daily prevents TPN-induced stasis and sludge in the gallbladder. We conclude that rapid IVAA should be used as routine prophylaxis against biliary sludge and formation of gallstones in patients receiving long-term TPN.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD009323|22435160|Single incision tans-umbilical laparoscopic cholecystectomy using conventional laparoscopic instruments: initial experience of single institute.|Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) had been considered the gold standard treatment for symptomatic gall bladder (GB) stones. Single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) was emerged as a less invasive alternative with better cosmesis and less post operative pain. This study evaluated the feasibility, safety, advantages and complications of SILC using the conventional laparoscopic instruments. A total of 52 patients (47 females and 5 males) with symptomatic GB stones underwent elective SILC using the conventional laparoscopic instruments. The mean operative time was 61.75 min and the mean estimated blood loss was 17.21 ml. Gall bladder perforation occurred in 5 cases (9.6%) in which 3 cases calculi spillage occurred. Troublesome cystic artery bleeding occurred in 2 cases (3.8%) while gall bladder bed bleeding happened in 1 case (1.9%). An intraoperative cholangiogram was performed in 3 cases and a drain was inserted in one case. No conversions of the technique occurred. 49 patients discharged in the first post operative day and 3 patients (5.8 %) in the 2nd day. Three month post operative wound length was an average of 1.58 cm while patient satisfaction of the surgery was an average of 9.32.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

CD010339|19322914|Acute pancreatitis: etiology and common pathogenesis.|Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas. The etiology and pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis have been intensively investigated for centuries worldwide. Many causes of acute pancreatitis have been discovered, but the pathogenetic theories are controversial. The most common cause of acute pancreatitis is gallstone impacting the distal common bile-pancreatic duct. The majority of investigators accept that the main factors for acute billiary pancreatitis are pancreatic hyperstimulation and bile-pancreatic duct obstruction which increase pancreatic duct pressure and active trypsin reflux. Acute pancreatitis occurs when intracellular protective mechanisms to prevent trypsinogen activation or reduce trypsin activity are overwhelmed. However, little is known about the other acute pancreatitis. We hypothesize that acute biliary pancreatitis and other causes of acute pancreatitis possess a common pathogenesis. Pancreatic hyperstimulation and pancreatic duct obstruction increase pancreatic duct pressure, active trypsin reflux, and subsequent unregulated activation of trypsin within pancreatic acinar cells. Enzyme activation within the pancreas leads to auto-digestion of the gland and local inflammation. Once the hypothesis is confirmed, traditional therapeutic strategies against acute pancreatitis may be improved. Decompression of pancreatic duct pressure should be advocated in the treatment of acute pancreatitits which may greatly improve its outcome.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Thirty-one patients had LICU examination of the extrahepatic bile ducts after exposure of the gallbladder but prior to dissection of the cystic duct. After LICU examination, cystic duct dissection and cholangiography were done. Evaluation of duct anatomy and decision for duct exploration were based on findings of both tests. All patients had successful LICU examination and 30 had successful cholangiography. Duct size as determined by LICU corresponded precisely with cholangiography.

CD009323|1410361|Intraoperative bile duct sonography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: experience with a 12.5-MHz catheter-based US probe.|During elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 20 patients underwent intraoperative evaluation of the biliary tract with a commercial 6.2-F, 12.5-MHz catheter-based ultrasound (US) probe. The study tested the feasibility of this technology for mapping the anatomy of the hepatoduodenal ligament and Calot triangle, assessing bile duct integrity, and detecting choledocholithiasis. The duct was studied with a transmural approach, the catheter being placed parallel to, but remaining outside, the bile duct. The common hepatic duct and common bile duct in the vicinity of the cystic duct were seen in all 20 patients; the junction of the cystic duct with the common hepatic duct was seen in nine patients (45%). After the cystic duct was clamped, no sonographic evidence to suggest bile duct injury was noted in any patient. The transmural imaging approach was tested in four pigs in whose common bile duct a single human calculus had been placed. In all instances the size and location of the calculus were accurately detected. Intraoperative US with a catheter-based system is a safe and effective means for interrogation of the extrahepatic biliary tree during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

In view of the hypothesis that strains of E. c. form an essential factor in infections of the bile ducts, an attempt has been made to determine the connection between infections of the bile ducts and the adherence of E. c. to the epithelium of the gallbladder. The research covered 148 patients operated electively for cholecystolithiasis (121), cholecystocholedocholithiasis (26) and recurrent lithiasis (1). In bile collected from the gallbladder in the course of the operation, E. coli strains were isolated. Cholangioscopy performed in 26 patients enabled the macroscopic evaluation and grading of inflammatory lesions of bile duct mucosa. The mucosa of the gallbladder was evaluated histologically. The adherence test was performed using homologous and heterologous strains of E. c. isolated from the bile of gallstone patients. The adherence occurred most frequently in the neck of the gallbladder (71-100%) in those patients in whom an infectious process of the bile ducts mucosa was endoscopically diagnosed. The adherence of bacteria to the epithelium of the gallbladder did not depend on the type of inflammation (acute, chronic).|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Genetic mutations of ABCB4 lead to three distinct but related hepatobiliary diseases. Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) type 3 is a chronic cholestatic syndrome characterized by a markedly elevated gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. Patients present with jaundice, pruritus, and hepatosplenomegaly. Periportal inflammation progresses to biliary cirrhosis and causes portal hypertension. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) normalizes liver function tests in approximately one half of treated PFIC type 3 patients. Partial responders or nonresponders eventually will require liver transplantation. Gallstone patients with ABCB4 mutations may have low phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis syndrome, characterized by cholesterol gallstones and intrahepatic microlithiasis, along with recurrent biliary symptoms, despite cholecystectomy. Patients with ABCB4 mutations also may develop intrahepatic brown pigment stones. UDCA may improve biliary symptoms even before the dissolution of stones occurs. Additional therapies such as farnesoid X receptor ligands/agonists and benzfibrates show future therapeutic promise. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy affects pregnant women with abnormal ABCB4. These women suffer from disabling pruritus and also may experience steatorrhea. Fetuses are at high risk for prematurity and stillbirths. The definitive treatment is delivery of the baby. In the interim, limited fat intake, fat-soluble vitamin supplementation, and UDCA with or without S-adenosylmethionine can provide symptomatic relief. Additional hepatobiliary diseases related to ABCB4 mutations are likely to be identified.

In 207 patients with gallstones, gallbladder puncture was performed under local anesthesia with a 22-gauge spinal needle under continuous real-time ultrasound guidance. Bile samples were investigated for biliary lipids and nucleation time. Complete aspiration of gallbladder bile could be achieved in all patients without complications such as bleeding, bile leak, or inflammation. Of these patients, 11.6% reported mild abdominal problems, 3.4% required analgetics, and in 1.0% biliary colics were observed. Elective cholecystectomy was performed in 1 patient. Of the bile samples, 10.1% were contaminated with bactobilia. Biliary lipids, cholesterol saturation index (CSI), total lipid concentration (TLC), and bacteriological contamination were independent of gallstone number, whereas patients with solitary gallbladder stones exhibited a significantly longer nucleation time (NT) in comparison with those with multiple stones.

CD011549|7737635|Diagnostic value of fine-needle puncture of the gallbladder: side effects, safety, and prognostic value.|Bile sampling without the risk of contamination by pancreatic and duodenal secretions and avoiding unpredictable influences of general anesthesia during biliary surgery on biliary analytics are feasible with percutaneous puncture of the gallbladder. In 207 patients with gallstones, gallbladder puncture was performed under local anesthesia with a 22-gauge spinal needle under continuous real-time ultrasound guidance. Bile samples were investigated for biliary lipids and nucleation time. Complete aspiration of gallbladder bile could be achieved in all patients without complications such as bleeding, bile leak, or inflammation. Of these patients, 11.6% reported mild abdominal problems, 3.4% required analgetics, and in 1.0% biliary colics were observed. Elective cholecystectomy was performed in 1 patient. Of the bile samples, 10.1% were contaminated with bactobilia. Biliary lipids, cholesterol saturation index (CSI), total lipid concentration (TLC), and bacteriological contamination were independent of gallstone number, whereas patients with solitary gallbladder stones exhibited a significantly longer nucleation time (NT) in comparison with those with multiple stones.

CD010339|21915383|Cystic duct remnant syndrome.|Post-cholecystectomy syndrome (PCS) is a common manifestation in patients with cholecystectomy. The patients exhibit a heterogeneous group of symptoms, such as upper abdominal pain, vomiting, gastrointestinal disorders, jaundice, and dyspepsia. Choledocholithiasis, biliary dyskinesia, and dilation of cystic duct remnants are common causes of these symptoms. The symptoms can recur after a symptom-free period following cholecystectomy or they can persist after surgery. Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging scan, which are non-invasive methods of imaging, have a high sensitivity in detecting the causes of PCS. We report a case of an 84-year-old lady who came to the Ultrasound Department with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain following cholecystectomy. The gray-scale sonography showed a dilated cystic structure, which was confirmed as the duct remnant in follow-up contrast-enhanced CT.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|2763947|MR appearance of gallstones in vitro at 1.5 T: correlation with chemical composition.|Gallstones from 63 patients were evaluated by in vitro 1.5-T MR imaging, with T1- and T2-weighted images, and in 14 cases, a fat-suppression sequence (short-T1 inversion recovery imaging). Subsequent chemical analysis was performed on 43 gallstones. In vitro proton MR spectroscopy was performed on 14 stones. On T1-weighted MR images, foci of increased signal were seen in 46 of 63 stones (faint in 17, moderate in nine, and bright in 20). T2-weighted images showed areas of increased signal in 18 of 63 stones (faint in 15, moderate in three). T1-weighted MR imaging patterns were homogeneously dark (17), homogeneously bright (two), homogeneously faint (three), rimmed (dark rim and bright center, 32), and laminated (nine). Short-T1 inversion recovery imaging suppressed the foci of increased signal in 13 of 14 cases. Despite imaging characteristics suggestive of high lipid content, spectroscopy revealed only a single peak corresponding to a large water-proton signal. The T1 relaxation times of the water were shortened, ranging from 0.006 to 0.92 sec, explaining the increased signal seen on MR images of the gallstones. MR imaging characteristics (signal intensity, relative signal area, or imaging patterns) did not correlate with chemical composition. We hypothesize that different structural relationships must exist within gallstones of similar chemical content that alter the water bonding and hence the MR imaging characteristics.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was scheduled in eighty-nine of 184 consecutive patients with acute calculous cholecystitis who underwent urgent or early cholecystectomy without bile duct exploration in our department between 1991 and 1998. The correlation between 11 preoperative clinical, laboratory and ultrasonographic variables, and the rate of conversion to open cholecystectomy was studied. Among the 11 variables tested, age and leukocyte count were independent factors of predictive significance. These two factors were used for constructing an additive prognostic index for conversion to open cholecystectomy. Thus, three groups of patients could be identified having a 10%, 30-70% or over 88% risk of conversion.

CD010339|6587545|Specifications of endoscopic ultrasonography.|In this paper we are going to describe the specifications of endoscopic ultrasonography using the equipment type III (Olympus GF- UMI ) on a basis of experiences in 45 patients during the past one year. The main body of the instrument is a standard type of gastroscope, Olympus GF-B3. The ultrasonic probe is incorporated into the tip of the endoscope. This instrument makes possible endoscopic visualization of the UGI tract and, at the same one time, allows us to do ultrasonic scanning of internal organs in the neighbourhood of the UGI tract. The better resolution of ultrasonic image is definitely obtained with this instrument than that of the conventional ultrasonography because its ultrasonography is intraluminally performed with high frequency transducer of 7.5 MHz and the image is never disturbed by the gastroduodenal gas nor the abdominal wall tissues. Endoscopic ultrasonography using the equipment type III is useful as a new diagnostic tool of great value in gastroenterology. However, there still remain a few mechanical points to be improved. It is desired that the rigid section of the tip of the endoscope is shortened more and the stability of the endoscopic image is guaranteed. These improvements would heighten its diagnostic value.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

In a consecutive series of 418 patients undergoing LC, common bile duct (CBD) stones were suspected pre-operatively in 130 patients. Forty-five of the patients (35%) were found to have CBD stones on either pre-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP; 20) or on operative cholangiography (OC; 25). Common bile duct stones were detected on OC in a further 12 of 288 patients (4.2%) without pre-operative suspicion of choledocholithiasis. Of the total of 57 patients with CBD stones, the duct was cleared by pre-operative ERCP and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) in 15 patients. In 13 patients, two of whom had had a pre-operative ERCP and ES, duct clearance was achieved by relaxing the sphincter pharmacologically and flushing the CBD via the OC catheter. One patient had an on-table ERCP and ES with successful stone extraction during LC. Eleven patients were converted to open operation with bile duct exploration. Sixteen patients had a postoperative ERCP. In five patients the CBD stones had passed spontaneously in the time between LC and ERCP. Ten patients required ES to clear the duct of stones. One patient had a failed ERCP and is still awaiting a repeat. The remaining patient was scheduled, but did not return for follow-up ERCP. In summary, pre-operative ERCP was indicated in less than 10% of patients in this series.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Criteria for selection included a history of biliary colic, not more than 3 stones with a total diameter of not more than 30 mm, and a functioning gallbladder. 210 patients were examined, of whom 98 were referred for additional screening by combined ultrasonography and oral cholecystography. This resulted in rejection of another 71 patients due to multiple stones (38%), nonfunctioning gallbladder (22%), calcified stones (12%), stones not visualized in the prone position (9%), excessively large stones (3%) and other reasons (16%). Only 27 patients fulfilled all the criteria. Under epidural or general anesthesia (11 and 2 patients, respectively), we administered 1200-3500 (mean 2250 +/- 750) shock waves at 20-24 KV with the Tripter X1 (Direx, Israel-USA). This is an ultrasound-guided, modular portable, shock-wave generator utilizing underwater high energy spark discharge. Chenodeoxycholic or ursodeoxycholic acid, 10 mg/kg/day, was started 1 week prior to ESWL and continued for 3 months after disappearance of fragments and debris. We encountered skin petechiae in all patients, transient hematuria in 8, mild biliary colic in 1 and a small liver hematoma in 1. To date, 3 patients are free of stones, while in 7 only sludge and tiny fragments are present which we expect to disappear as a result of the litholytic therapy. 3 patients had fragments larger than 5 mm and required a second ESWL.

Complete or partial gallstone dissolution was achieved in 74 (59 per cent). However, only 22 achieved complete gallstone dissolution, as judged by two normal oral cholecystograms; ultrasonograms were performed in 16 of these patients, and all were normal. UDCA was stopped in 76 patients: because of cystic duct obstruction (n = 12), severe biliary pain (n = 13), non-response (n = 25) or partial stone dissolution with arrested progress (n = 26). Life-table analysis showed that complete gallstone dissolution rates at four years were 25-30 per cent (two normal oral cholecystograms) and 17-19 per cent (two normal oral cholecystograms plus one ultrasonogram). All patients with complete gallstone dissolution had shown partial stone dissolution at 6-12 months; of those with partial stone dissolution at six months, only 25 per cent went on to complete gallstone dissolution, and then always within two years. Efficacy correlated inversely with stone size but not with age, sex, obesity or on-treatment saturation indices. Acquired surface gallstone calcification developed in 13 patients (life-table analysis 22 +/- 7 per cent at four years); none of these patients achieved complete gallstone dissolution and only five achieved partial stone dissolution. Thus, despite relatively high partial gallstone dissolution rates, the ultimate efficacy of UDCA in achieving complete gallstone dissolution is low.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Plastic stents, among others, can be used as an escape route in patients with large common bile duct stones, or in cases of acute cholangitis with or without sphincterotomy to provide drainage until definitive treatment. Stent occlusion is the main disadvantage, limiting their patency to around 3 months, after which replacement is recommended. We present a case of a large, close to 2cm, stone developing around and encasing the proximal end of a plastic biliary stent. The stent/stone complex was successfully removed en bloc. The stent was placed in the common bile duct without sphincterotomy, and remained in situ for 2 years. The presented case highlights the importance of definitive treatment for common bile duct stones, the need to respect the ductal axis especially when dealing with large stones and the significance of biliary sphincterotomy during endoscopic interventions in the bile duct.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|15757145|[Bile duct laparoscopic exploration].|The use of ERCP with endoscopic esphincterotomy (ES) for the management of choledocholithiasis has replaced almost completely common bile duct exploration in the era of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Once the procedure is completed it is followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the same hospitalization. During the last few years, the development of new technology and equipment with possibilities of minimal invasive procedures and diagnosis, as well as the ongoing surgical skills has allowed surgeons to solve the problem of choledocholithiasis in one minimal invasive procedure, decreasing effectively morbidity with a high success rate, changing again ERCP with ES as a complement and not as a substitute for surgery. Nevertheless the initial step in the use of these techniques require of a special technical support and what is most important capacitation to achieve the desire objectives. Transcystic technique seems to be the most promising and choledochotomy with primary closure in cases that cannot be solved with the transcystic approach.

CD011548|15757145|[Bile duct laparoscopic exploration].|The use of ERCP with endoscopic esphincterotomy (ES) for the management of choledocholithiasis has replaced almost completely common bile duct exploration in the era of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Once the procedure is completed it is followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the same hospitalization. During the last few years, the development of new technology and equipment with possibilities of minimal invasive procedures and diagnosis, as well as the ongoing surgical skills has allowed surgeons to solve the problem of choledocholithiasis in one minimal invasive procedure, decreasing effectively morbidity with a high success rate, changing again ERCP with ES as a complement and not as a substitute for surgery. Nevertheless the initial step in the use of these techniques require of a special technical support and what is most important capacitation to achieve the desire objectives. Transcystic technique seems to be the most promising and choledochotomy with primary closure in cases that cannot be solved with the transcystic approach.

CD010339|6486112|Gallbladder dynamics in response to various meals: is dietary fat restriction necessary in the management of gallstones?|An estimated 20 million Americans have gallstones the majority asymptomatic. Yet traditionally many are often placed on low-fat or fat-free diets, presumably to reduce the risk of biliary colic. To assess the gallbladder dynamics in response to various meals, we studied 15 subjects (ages 21-54), each on 4 separate days. After an overnight fast, each subject was given, at random, either a breakfast containing greater than 30 g fat, less than 15 g fat, totally free of fat, or an infusion of C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin. Gallbladder ejections at regular time intervals were measured using real time ultrasonography and the sum of cylinders technic corrected for the gallbladder shape. Considerable variability in the gallbladder dynamics and time response was noted with all the stimuli. However, among various meals, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean maximum ejection fraction or the mean maximum ejection time (p greater than 0.10). The mean maximum ejection fraction after cholecystokinin was somewhat greater (0.01 less than p less than 0.05) than that after meals, but the mean maximum ejection time was similar (p greater than 0.10). We conclude that the gallbladder dynamics in response to various meals are independent of a meal's fat content. Since the passage of gallstones into the cystic or common duct (biliary colic) is a random event unrelated to the type of food, fat-restricted diets offer no significant therapeutic advantage in the management of the large population with asymptomatic gallstones.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7060890|Gallbladder function in the human female: effect of the ovulatory cycle, pregnancy, and contraceptive steroids.|We have previously shown that in pregnancy fasting gallbladder volume is increased and emptying after a small volume liquid meal is incomplete. In this study we measured gallbladder volume throughout day and night in healthy women ingesting regular meals. Pregnant women, postpartum women, contraceptive-steroid users, and controls in both phases of the ovulatory cycle were studied. After an overnight fast gallbladder volume was measured by realtime ultrasonography in the fasting state and every 5-10 min for 90 min after breakfast. Residual volume was the lowest volume achieved and the rate constant of gallbladder emptying was calculated from the ln/linear regression of gallbladder volume vs. time. Gallbladder volume was also measured hourly from 11 AM to midnight while subjects ate regular, standard meals, allowing the determination of an average hourly volume. There was no effect of phase of the ovulatory cycle on any measure of gallbladder function. Fasting, residual, and average hourly volume were increased in all trimesters of pregnancy, but tended to return to normal in the postpartum period. Women taking contraceptive steroids had an increased fasting volume. Two distinct rates of emptying after breakfast, an early and a late one, were identified. The early rate was the same in all groups. Pregnant women had a slower late rate of emptying, but women taking contraceptive steroids had emptying rates similar to controls. Retention of bile in the gallbladder may be one reason for the increased risk of cholesterol cholelithiasis in pregnant women and in those taking contraceptive steroids.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

An interim report of the Dornier U.S. Bile Duct Lithotripsy Prospective Study.|A multi-institutional study to evaluate the efficacy, clinical application, and safety of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) with the Dornier HM-3 or HM-4 lithotripter for bile duct calculi (BDC) was initiated in September, 1987. Symptomatic patients who entered into this prospective trial had BDC in the common bile duct and/or the intrahepatic, cystic or lobar ducts of the liver that were inaccessible or untreatable by papillotomy or percutaneous stone extraction. The study excluded gallbladder stones. Nasobiliary (54.4%) or transhepatic catheters (10.5%) and T-tube or cholecystostomy tubes (17.5%) or combinations (14.0%) permitted access for radiographic contrast to allow fluoroscopic monitoring of stone position and fragmentation. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, failure to localize the stone, disturbances of coagulation, pacemakers, or vascular aneurysms or large bones that lie in the focal axis of the shock waves. Eleven institutions treated 42 patients (23 male, 19 female) with BDC; age range was 25 to 95 years (mean +/- SD, 73.5 +/- 13.8) and ASA risk category was 1 to 4 (mean, 2.3 +/- 0.8). Fourteen patients (33.3%) had a single BDC; 28 had 2 to 8 stones (mean, 2.7 +/- 1.8) ranging in size from 6 mm to 30 mm (mean, 18.5 +/- 6.4). The majority (66.7%) of patients were postcholecystectomy. The 42 patients received 57 ESWL treatments consisting of 600 to 2400 shocks per treatment (mean, 1924 +/- 289) at 12 to 22 kV (mean, 18.5 +/- 1.9) administered over 20 to 125 minutes (mean, 52.9 +/- 20.8). General anesthesia was used in 32% of the treatments; the majority were treated with epidural or regional block (42.1%), local infiltration (28.1%), or intravenous sedation (38.6%). Fifteen patients (35.7%) required two ESWL treatments. Stone fragmentation occurred in 94.6% of evaluable patients and in 90.4% of ESWL treatments, respectively; however, BDC fragments remained in 59.5% of patients 24 hours after treatment (diameter less than or to 3 mm, 12%; 4 to 9 mm, 16%; greater than or equal to 10 mm, 68%). Some patients (50%) required adjunctive procedures to achieve stone removal that included endoscopic extraction (n = 10; 47.6%), biliary lavage (n = 8; 38.1%), endoscopic bile duct prosthesis (n = 1; 4.8%), and operation (n = 2; 9.5%). ESWL treatment complications during hospitalization were observed in 15 patients (35.7%) and were present in four (9.5%) at discharge. Complications included macrohematuria (5%), biliary pain (15%), biliary sepsis (5%), hemobilia (10%), ileus (2.5%), and adverse pulmonary changes (7.5%).

CD010339|6287656|A clinical study of cholangiocarcinoma caused cholestasis in Thailand.|Cholangiocarcinoma is the leading cause of cholestasis among patients with malignant tumors, 63.5 per cent, while carcinoma of the head of the pancreas is the most common cause in western countries. A clinical history of progressive cholestasis; signs and symptoms of cholestasis; slow progressive clinical course, and mostly importantly, 96.7 per cent stemming from an endemic area of opisthorchiasis are all shown in this study. The peak age for this disease in Thailand was about one decade younger than that in western countries. The anatomic lesions in 96.7 per cent were found in the hilar area of the liver and only 3.3 per cent in the lower third of the liver compared with a significant number of lesions in the middle and lower thirds of the liver, as reported in literature from the western countries. We believe that percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography prior to the operation will definitely help the surgeon in deciding upon the surgical approach. Surgical intervention of a cholangiocarcinomatous lesion is probably more difficult in Thailand than in western countries because of location. The incidence for cholangiocarcinoma associated with biliary calculi and for an opisthorchiatic cyst is 8.1 and 6.1 per cent. We would like to emphasize the close association between cholangiocarcinoma and the combination of opisthorchiasis with carcinogenic agents, such as nitrosamines in the favorite local dish. The animal experimental model, using Syrian golden hamsters, produced the same result and the same site for the lesion--the hilar area of the liver.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones
CD011548|6287656|A clinical study of cholangiocarcinoma caused cholestasis in Thailand.|Cholangiocarcinoma is the leading cause of cholestasis among patients with malignant tumors, 63.5 per cent, while carcinoma of the head of the pancreas is the most common cause in western countries. A clinical history of progressive cholestasis; signs and symptoms of cholestasis; slow progressive clinical course, and mostly importantly, 96.7 per cent stemming from an endemic area of opisthorchiasis are all shown in this study. The peak age for this disease in Thailand was about one decade younger than that in western countries. The anatomic lesions in 96.7 per cent were found in the hilar area of the liver and only 3.3 per cent in the lower third of the liver compared with a significant number of lesions in the middle and lower thirds of the liver, as reported in literature from the western countries. We believe that percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography prior to the operation will definitely help the surgeon in deciding upon the surgical approach. Surgical intervention of a cholangiocarcinomatous lesion is probably more difficult in Thailand than in western countries because of location.

CD010339|7552015|Prospective evaluation in 121 consecutive unselected patients undergoing laparoscopic treatment of choledocholithiasis.|Laparoscopic common bile duct (CBD) exploration was attempted in 115 of 121 consecutive unselected patients with choledocholithiasis (mean age 69 (range 21-92) years) found during routine intraoperative cholangiography. The CBD was successfully cleared of all stones in 100 patients (87 per cent). Ten of 11 patients referred for surgery after failure of endoscopic sphincterotomy had complete laparoscopic choledocholithiasis. Eleven patients (10 per cent) required conversion to open CBD exploration, and laparoscopic exploration was not attempted in six (5 per cent) because of inflammation or fibrosis. Postoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy was required in four patients (4 per cent) for retained stones after laparoscopic exploration. There were no postoperative deaths (39 per cent of patients were aged 75 years or more). Routine intraoperative cholangiography, and when required laparoscopic CBD exploration, should be compared in randomized trials with preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography in patients with suspected choledocholithiasis.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Common bile duct stones (CBS) were found in four patients (11%, 95% confidence limits 3-25%). Due to a history of jaundice and/or elevated liver function tests, CBS were suspected in three of these patients, and unexpected in one. Totally, CBS were suspected in eight patients, either because of their history and/or elevated liver function tests. No side effects were observed during or after the IVC procedure. It can be concluded that IVC is a lenient procedure for radiological assessment of the common bile duct prior to elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It can be recommended as an alternative to diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiography in patients in whom CBS are suspected.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|8161906|Gallbladder sludge formation after bone marrow transplant: sonographic observations.|We prospectively studied 12 patients before and after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with serial sonography to evaluate gallbladder sludge formation. Patients were studied on four separate occasions to assess the gallbladder for sludge and stones: prior to BMT and conditioning chemoradiation, and on days 3, 13, and 28 after BMT. During two of the sonographic studies, gallbladder volume measurements were made before and after administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-OP) and the ejection fraction (EF) was calculated. Medical records were reviewed for symptoms of cholecystitis, narcotic use, and dietary intake. Sludge and/or stones developed in eight of 12 patients (67%), and in four patients sludge was observed by day 3 post-BMT. Ejection fraction was normal (> 50%) pre-BMT in six of the eight patients who developed sludge, and in four of these six post-BMT. Furthermore, five of the eight patients developed sludge and/or stones in the absence of fasting and/or narcotic use. We conclude that gallbladder sludge develops frequently and early in BMT patients and may resolve or progress to stone formation. We did not demonstrate a relationship between impaired contractility and the development of sludge and/or stones, nor did we find a strong association between sludge formation and conditions presumed to cause gallbladder stasis, such as narcotic use and fasting. These findings suggest that other factors apart from impaired gallbladder contractility may play a role in the formation of sludge in the BMT patient.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7657495|Malignant potential of the gallbladder in patients with anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal junction. The difference in risk between patients with and without choledochal cyst.|Anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal junction (APBDJ) is considered to be a factor developing carcinoma of the biliary tract. However, the difference in clinical significance of APBDJ between patients associated with choledochal cyst and those without cyst with special reference to the malignant potential of the gallbladder has been little studied. Of 1,325 patients examined with direct cholangiography, 29 patients were found to have APBDJ of whom 21 patients were associated with choledochal cyst while eight were not. Their associated hepatobiliary diseases were clinicopathologically examined and compared. The frequencies of carcinoma of the gallbladder in patients without choledochal cyst and in those with cyst were 50% and 5%, respectively, the difference being significant (p < 0.05). This frequency did not depend upon the type of APBDJ. None of the patients with gallbladder carcinoma had gallstones. The overall frequencies of carcinoma of the biliary tract (gallbladder and bile duct) were 14% in patients with cyst and 50% in those without cyst. All were gallbladder carcinoma in the latter group. We conclude that the gallbladder is under the condition with significantly greater malignant potential in patients with APBDJ especially in cases not associated with choledochal cyst. Prophylactic cholecystectomy and excision of cyst if associated should be indicated for patients with APBDJ.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Thirty patients had periampullary duodenal diverticula, and 14 had no diverticula. Because periampullary diverticula were associated with biliary and pancreatic complications, possibly as a result of stasis in the diverticula, the clinical course in patients with and without diverticula was compared. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was well tolerated and resulted in a rapid clinical improvement in all patients. There were four complications related to the procedure (pancreatitis, two, and cholangitis, two), all were treated conservatively, and there were no deaths. The clinical outcome was similar in both groups of patients. During a mean follow-up of 25 months (range, 6 to 58), only two patients (one of each group) underwent elective cholecystectomy 2 and 3 months after initial presentation. It is concluded that endoscopic sphincterotomy is a safe and effective alternative to surgery as an initial treatment in elderly patients with choledocholithiasis and gallbladder in situ.

CD010339|11505633|Acute pancreatitis in the Zabok General Hospital.|Acute pancreatitis is an acute disease of the pancreas due to the organ autodigestion. The disease is still burdened with numerous complications and quite frequently with lethal outcome, in spite of the sophisticated diagnostic and therapeutic methods currently available. The disease has a benign course in a majority of patients (80%), however, in the remaining 20% it assumes a malignant course with the development of massive necroses of the pancreatic and peripancreatic tissues, infection, hemorrhage, and endogenous intoxication with lesions of the lungs, kidneys, heart and liver. The biliary tract disease plays the major role in the etiology of acute pancreatitis (80%), followed by alcoholism (10% to 15%). This differs from the experience acquired at the Zabok General Hospital, where an almost identical incidence of biliary and ethylic etiology was recorded. Other, less common causes include post-traumatic, postoperative, infective and hormonal (hyperparathyroidism) etiology. In some cases, the cause of acute pancreatitis remains unknown. The disease shows a female predominance, which results from the higher prevalence of cholelithiasis in women than in men. Anatomically, there are two main forms of acute pancreatitis, interstitial or edematous form, and hemorrhagic necrotizing form. The interstitial or edematous form of acute pancreatitis is characterized by edema (exudation) of the pancreatic interstitium. The hemorrhagic necrotizing form of acute pancreatitis is characterized by autodigestion of a minor or major portion of the pancreas and peripancreatic tissues. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis may initially pose a considerable problem. Decision on the mode of treatment should primarily be based on the clinical picture and supported by relevant laboratory parameters and other diagnostic procedures (ultrasonography, computed tomography). Conservative therapy is indicated for the edematous form of acute pancreatitis, whereas operative treatment is as a rule used for the necrotizing form of acute pancreatitis. Secondary bacterial contamination of the necrotic foci with the development of septic complications occurs in more than 50% of patients with the necrotizing form of acute pancreatitis, and is an absolute indication for surgical intervention. The modes of treatment used in 57 patients admitted for acute pancreatitis during the 1996-1999 period are described. Cholelithiasis was the cause of acute pancreatitis in 28 (49.1%), and alcoholism in 29 (50.9%) patients. Conservative treatment was used in 41 (72%) patients. Sixteen (28%) patients underwent operative treatment. Explorative laparotomy and drainage were performed in four patients, and explorative laparotomy, necrectomy, sequestrectomy and drainage with two or more drains in 11 patients. Cholecystectomy and T drainage along with necrectomy and drainage were performed in one patient. There were 12 (21%) patients with the most severe form of acute pancreatitis. Nine of these patients were operated on (necrectomy drainage) between day 6 and 10 of the disease. Two of these patients had to be reoperated on within a month, due to necrosis and abscess recurrence. Three of the 12 patients with the severe form of acute pancreatitis received conservative therapy. Fifteen patients were operated on 8-10 weeks after acute pancreatitis had subsided. Pseudocysts developed in three patients. These patients were operated on 6-8 weeks from the onset of disease, with internal drainage via isolated small intestine flexure performed in all of these patients. The mean duration of intensive care unit stay for all patients with acute pancreatitis was 20.6 days. Four of 57 patients hospitalized for acute pancreatitis died. The mortality rate in the group of patients with the severe form of acute pancreatitis (n = 12) was 33%. Complications developed in 50% of operatively treated patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD011549|11505633|Acute pancreatitis in the Zabok General Hospital.|Acute pancreatitis is an acute disease of the pancreas due to the organ autodigestion. The disease is still burdened with numerous complications and quite frequently with lethal outcome, in spite of the sophisticated diagnostic and therapeutic methods currently available. The disease has a benign course in a majority of patients (80%), however, in the remaining 20% it assumes a malignant course with the development of massive necroses of the pancreatic and peripancreatic tissues, infection, hemorrhage, and endogenous intoxication with lesions of the lungs, kidneys, heart and liver. The biliary tract disease plays the major role in the etiology of acute pancreatitis (80%), followed by alcoholism (10% to 15%). This differs from the experience acquired at the Zabok General Hospital, where an almost identical incidence of biliary and ethylic etiology was recorded. Other, less common causes include post-traumatic, postoperative, infective and hormonal (hyperparathyroidism) etiology. In some cases, the cause of acute pancreatitis remains unknown. The disease shows a female predominance, which results from the higher prevalence of cholelithiasis in women than in men. Anatomically, there are two main forms of acute pancreatitis, interstitial or edematous form, and hemorrhagic necrotizing form. The interstitial or edematous form of acute pancreatitis is characterized by edema (exudation) of the pancreatic interstitium. The hemorrhagic necrotizing form of acute pancreatitis is characterized by autodigestion of a minor or major portion of the pancreas and peripancreatic tissues. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis may initially pose a considerable problem. Decision on the mode of treatment should primarily be based on the clinical picture and supported by relevant laboratory parameters and other diagnostic procedures (ultrasonography, computed tomography). Conservative therapy is indicated for the edematous form of acute pancreatitis, whereas operative treatment is as a rule used for the necrotizing form of acute pancreatitis. Secondary bacterial contamination of the necrotic foci with the development of septic complications occurs in more than 50% of patients with the necrotizing form of acute pancreatitis, and is an absolute indication for surgical intervention. The modes of treatment used in 57 patients admitted for acute pancreatitis during the 1996-1999 period are described. Cholelithiasis was the cause of acute pancreatitis in 28 (49.1%), and alcoholism in 29 (50.9%) patients. Conservative treatment was used in 41 (72%) patients. Sixteen (28%) patients underwent operative treatment. Explorative laparotomy and drainage were performed in four patients, and explorative laparotomy, necrectomy, sequestrectomy and drainage with two or more drains in 11 patients. Cholecystectomy and T drainage along with necrectomy and drainage were performed in one patient. There were 12 (21%) patients with the most severe form of acute pancreatitis. Nine of these patients were operated on (necrectomy drainage) between day 6 and 10 of the disease. Two of these patients had to be reoperated on within a month, due to necrosis and abscess recurrence. Three of the 12 patients with the severe form of acute pancreatitis received conservative therapy. Fifteen patients were operated on 8-10 weeks after acute pancreatitis had subsided. Pseudocysts developed in three patients. These patients were operated on 6-8 weeks from the onset of disease, with internal drainage via isolated small intestine flexure performed in all of these patients. The mean duration of intensive care unit stay for all patients with acute pancreatitis was 20.6 days. Four of 57 patients hospitalized for acute pancreatitis died. The mortality rate in the group of patients with the severe form of acute pancreatitis (n = 12) was 33%.

Nevertheless, bile duct injuries and other post-cholecystectomy complications are a serious problem and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Early complications may include bile duct injury caused by mistakenly placed clips, erroneous cutting of bile ducts based on misinterpretation of biliary anatomy, periductal bile leakage that causes edema, fibrosis and secondary stricturing, and ischemia due to injury to the right hepatic artery. Bile duct strictures are the most common of the late complications and can develop a few months or many years after surgery. Early detection and accurate diagnosis have a fundamental importance for the successful treatment of these complications. Therefore, early and meaningful application of the imaging methods immediately after detection of the first symptoms is essential. Peroperative ultrasound and direct iodine contrast application into the biliary tree (operative cholangiography) are highly important for immediate visualization of the complications during surgery. Ultrasound can be used to aid in identification of ductal structures and the cholangiogram should be obtained to document the anatomy.

CD010339|10791226|Doppler sonography in hepatolithiasis: a case report.|"In the treatment of hepatolithiasis, it is important to not only remove all stones and eliminate bile stasis in the biliary tract, but also to remove atrophic hepatic tissue, as such tissue may cause recurrent cholangitis as well as latent cholangiocarcinoma. A 75-year-old woman was diagnosed as having hepatolithiasis with stenosis at the branching of the bile ducts in segment II and segment III by sonography, computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, and magnetic resonance cholangiography. Portograms did not reveal portal branches in segment III but did demonstrate the portal branches in segment II. During the operation, Doppler sonography was done. Doppler sonography did not reveal the portal blood flow in segment III, but did demonstrate a ""to-and-fro"" pattern in the portal branches in segment II, indicating atrophic hepatic tissue with disrupted portal blood flow. Lateral segmentectomy (resection of segments II and III and lithotomy with choledo-chotomy were done. The patient is in good health 2 years 6 months after the operation. Doppler sonography is useful in the detection of disrupted portal blood flow and the diagnosis of hepatic atrophy.

Report of 10 cases and review of the literature in Japan.|During the last 8 years, the authors had experience with 10 cases of carcinoma of the gallbladder with an anomalous connection between the choledochus and the pancreatic duct. These cases were studied in reference to age, sex, frequency of gallstones and dilatation of the bile duct, amylase levels in bile, direct cholangiograms, histologic findings, methods of treatment, and prognosis. Histologically, intestinal metaplasia was noticed in cancerous areas and also in noncancerous areas of differentiated adenocarcinomas. These facts suggest that in carcinoma of the gallbladder with this anomaly, reflux and stasis of pancreatic juice in the gallbladder may induce chronic cholecystitis which leads to mucosal metaplasia and, eventually, to differentiated adenocarcinoma.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Gallbladder status was assessed by ultrasound; fatty acid composition of the habitual diet was estimated by GLC of erythrocyte fatty acids. No differences in erythrocyte fatty acid composition were observed between women without gallstones, women with gallstones (aware and unaware of their condition), and women who had cholecystectomies. Multivariate analysis, including other diet-dependent and gallstone-related variables, showed no significant association between erythrocyte fatty acids and risk for gallstones. However, raised erythrocyte linoleic:saturated ratio was associated with increased risk for gallstones only in women with very low serum triglycerides. This latter finding needs further confirmation and is presently unexplainable. Our results suggest that dietary fatty acids do not play a major role in GD.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Follow-up ranged from 1 to 14 years after surgery. Check-up examination included: 1) clinical assessment, 2) serum liver and pancreas function tests, and 3) ultrasonography. Good long-term clinical results were obtained in 50 cases. Seven patients complained of mild and temporary hepatic symptoms or digestive troubles. Three subjects developed severe symptoms: jaundice, fever, pain or ascites. The causes of the failures were: 1) recurrent stones in the distal portion of the common bile duct with cholangitis, 2) common hepatic duct stricture with recurrent stones and cholangitis, and 3) alcoholic cirrhosis. The following conclusions may be drawn: 1) Sphincteroplasty achieved a fourteen year success rate of 90% 2) Cholangitis, which supervened in 2 patients, was associated with bile duct strictures and recurrent stones. 3) The great majority of patients who had undergone sphincteroplasty, showed normal size of the bile ducts. However, 10% of patients still retained some degree of intrahepatic ductal dilatation. 4) Since recurrent bile duct stenoses occurred as far as 6 and 8 years after surgery, long-term follow-up is mandatory.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The following conclusions may be drawn: 1) Sphincteroplasty achieved a fourteen year success rate of 90% 2) Cholangitis, which supervened in 2 patients, was associated with bile duct strictures and recurrent stones. 3) The great majority of patients who had undergone sphincteroplasty, showed normal size of the bile ducts. However, 10% of patients still retained some degree of intrahepatic ductal dilatation. 4) Since recurrent bile duct stenoses occurred as far as 6 and 8 years after surgery, long-term follow-up is mandatory.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones
CD010339|1912714|Is ultrasonography a reliable method for evaluation of fragment clearance after biliary ESWL? A prospective, blinded study of two independent ultrasound units.|Ultrasound is the preceding method for evaluation of fragmentation and subsequent fragment clearance from the gallbladder. Considering the methodological shortcomings of ultrasonography, this study was therefore designed to investigate the degree of conformity between two independent ultrasound units. In our protocol patients were evaluated for fragments two weeks and three, six, nine and twelve months after ESWL. A restricted number of experienced sonographers in two independent ultrasound units examined the patient without knowledge of the other unit's findings. A total of 62 examinations have been carried out so far. Complete or sufficient conformity with a difference in size of 0-3mm was achieved in 24 examinations. Seven examinations revealed differences of 4-13 mm. In 31 cases the diagnosis of a stone-free gallbladder has been made, but only in 25 cases this could be confirmed by the other ultrasound unit. In six examinations a small fragment of less than 5mm was found by the respective other sonographer. We conclude that the diagnoses of a stone-free gallbladder after ESWL should be reconsidered by a second independent and experienced sonographer.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The diagnosis is based on classical symptoms of cholecystitis with the presence of >90% eosinophilic infiltration within the gallbladder. We report the case of a 29-yr-old man who presented with unremitting right upper quadrant pain, chills, and loss of appetite. After confirmation of the diagnosis with ultrasound and hepatobiliary scan (HIDA), a cholecystectomy was performed. Pathologic examination of the excised gallbladder demonstrated submucosal infiltration with eosinophils, consistent with EC. Peripheral eosinophilia was not observed; the subject's blood eosinophil count did not exceed 3% during the period of observation. The patient was discharged with no further symptoms. Cases of EC have been infrequently reported since its original description in 1949. EC has been reported alone or in combination with manifestations such as eosinophilic cholangitis, hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES), and parasitic infestations.

CD010339|8588413|Use of intraoperative ultrasonography during hepatolithectomy.|Complete clearance of intrahepatic stones has long been a major surgical challenge. To reduce the incidence of residual stones, we used intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) to localize them and guide lithectomy in 38 patients with hepatolithiasis between July 1988 and December 1993. All patients had multiple intrahepatic stones; 24 had accompanying extrahepatic calculi. Hepatic stones were confined to the left intrahepatic biliary tract in 13 patients, to the right in 9, and in both lobes in 16. Twenty-three patients underwent common bile duct exploration followed by T-tube drainage, 8 had transhepatic lithotomy with or without choledocholithotomy, 3 had choledocolithotomy and Roux-en-Y side-to-side choledochojejunostomy, and 2 had hepaticojejunostomy, left lobectomy was performed in the remainder. In 35 patients cholecystectomy was performed at the same time. Complete clearance of the stones was achieved in 36 patients (94.7%). The incidence of retained stone was decreased to 5.3%. No associated complications occurred. IOUS can accurately localize intrahepatic calculi, directly orient lithotomy instruments to approach the stones, demonstrate the spatial relation between stone and intrahepatic critical structure, and thereby choose an optical route for transhepatic lithotomy. Imaging can be repeated at any time with no radiation exposure to the patient or the medical staff.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

However, adaptation of LC is associated with increased risk of complications, particularly bile duct injury ranging from 0.3 to 0.6%. Occurrence of BDI results in difficult reconstruction, prolonged hospitalization, and high risk of long-term complications. Therefore, more emphasis is placed on preventing these complications. In addition to adequate training, several techniques have been proposed to prevent bile duct injury including use of 30° scope, adequate delineation of structures in Calot's triangle (critical view), avoidance of diathermy close to common hepatic duct, and intraoperative cholangiogram, and to maintain a low threshold to conversion to open approach when uncertain. Management of Bile duct injury depends on the nature of injury, time of detection, and the expertise available, and would range from simple subhepatic drainage to Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy particularly performed at specialised centers. This article based on the literature review aims to review the biliary complications following laparoscopic cholecystectomy with reference to its mechanism , preventive measures to be taken, and the management approach.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The present study is concerned with a group of patients undergoing medical therapy for gallstones for periods of 30 days up to 14 months with CDCA (15 mg/kg/day). Routine functional tests, determination of some liver microsomal enzymes and stereological studies of the liver tissue have been performed and the data have been compared with those obtained before treatment. No significant changes were observed in the functional tests throughout the study. Also the microsomal mixed function oxidase system seemed unaffected by CDCA therapy. The histological features of the liver biopsies were not appreciably different from those observed prior to treatment. Although there were large interindividual variations, the volume density of parenchymal steatosis and of the lipocytes remained comparable in the ssme individual. The ultrastructural features noted in untreated subjects such as curled mitochondrial cristae, slight intracellular bile retention, increased surface density of the rough endoplasmic reticulum were still evident after 14 months of treatment. No additional changes were noted. These results show that no evidence of hepatotoxicity seems to develop in man under therapy with CDCA at the dose considered.

A 65-year-old man with a twenty year history of cholecystolithiasis was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain and vomiting. Physical exams showed abdominal defence and rebound tenderness. A plain abdominal X-ray suggested a small bowel obstruction and pneumobilia. CT scan revealed a 2.5-cm gallstone at the jejunum and air in the biliary tree. The patient underwent a emergency laparotomy based on a diagnosis of panperitonitis with a perforation associated with gallstone ileus. Operative findings revealed a jejunal perforation and a impacted stone on the anal side of perforation. Enterolithotomy and jejunal resection were performed with cholecystectomy and repairment of the cholecystoduodenal fistula.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

A final analysis of the ultrasonographic data was carried out in 42 patients on whom laparotomy or endoscopic papillotomy with removal of common bile duct stones, confirmed the diagnosis. Evaluation of the role of second investigation following ultrasound in 28 patients (side-viewing endoscopy in 13, ERCP in 12 and PTC in 3) was also done to determine whether they provide any additional information over ultrasonography in delineating the exact level and etiology of biliary obstruction. US was done by the clinician who interpreted the findings in conjunction with the clinical profile of the patient. US correctly diagnosed SOJ in all 42 patients.

Apropos of 115 patients].|The gallbladder volume was measured on abdominal ultrasonography in 115 patients consisting of three population groups, before and after ingestion of a fatty meal and/or intravenous administration of cholecystokinin. The variation in volume, estimated as a percentage, was used to assess gallbladder contraction. The first group, consisting of 40 normal individuals without gallstones or impaired gallbladder or hepatic function, can be considered to constitute a control group. In this population, gallbladder contraction exceeded 50% in every case. The second group consisted of 40 cases of acute cholecystitis, including 30 cases with acute gallstones and 10 cases of stone-free acute cholecystitis proven surgically (7 cases) or by guided aspiration (3 cases). Gallbladder contraction was less than 15% in every case. Lastly, a third group of 35 patients with uncomplicated gallstones discovered on routine ultrasonography, demonstrated gallbladder contraction of between 10 and 85%. In this last group, 12 patients with vague gastrointestinal symptoms and gallbladder contraction less than 15% were operated: the histological results demonstrated severe lesions of chronic gallstone cholecystitis. The authors believe that absent or weak gallbladder contraction after endogenous stimulation is a supplementary sign to be taken into consideration in a context suggestive of the diagnosis of acute stone-free cholecystitis and to suggest, in the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms not directly related to the gallbladder, the hypothesis of chronic gallstone cholecystitis.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

An evaluation of 200 consecutive patients operated on for gallbladder stones.|Operative cholangiography (OC) was performed during open standard cholecystectomy in 195 of 200 consecutive patients. The cholangiography was considered suspicious for choledochal stones in 28 patients (14%). Both choledochotomy and choledochoscopy were carried out. Stones in the biliary tree were found in 17 patients and in 11 cases choledochotomy was negative. Cholecystectomy was performed on an emergency basis in 46 patients, 15 of them underwent choledochotomy and in 11 (24%) bile duct stones were found. In 154 electively operated patients six (4%) had choledochal stones. Based on preoperative history choledochal stones were suspected in 30 electively operated patients but only eight had stones in the biliary tree at the time of operation. The percentage of false positive cholangiograms was 6% in the whole material, and unsuspected choledochal stones were diagnosed in 5% respectively. It is recommended that operative cholangiography should be performed routinely in patients subjected to emergency cholecystectomy. In elective operations selective use is acceptable.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones

Chenodeoxycholic acid was given to 97 patients in a dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight per day for a period of two years. Complete gallstone dissolution occurred in 27 of 97 patients (28%). If dropouts are excluded then the success rate is 27 of 64 patients (42%). Diarrhea was a common but manageable side effect for most. Thirty-two percent of patients developed chemical liver test abnormality; however, in only 13% was the degree of abnormality sufficient to require temporary (3%) or permanent (10%) cessation of therapy. Although better chemotherapeutic agents are needed, chenodeoxycholic acid is a reasonable choice for patients with non-calcified cholelithiasis in a functioning gallbladder if the patient is a heightened surgical risk. Because of the prolonged treatment period and the possibility of hepatotoxicity this treatment program requires a substantial commitment on the part of both the patient and the physician.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD009323|10674747|Interval laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the management of acute biliary pancreatitis.|The timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy following an attack of acute biliary pancreatitis is controversial. The traditional approach of interval cholecystectomy has been challenged recently. The present study was designed to evaluate the benefits of interval laparoscopic cholecystectomy for patients with mild acute pancreatitis (Ranson less than 3). Nineteen patients with mild pancreatitis underwent ultrasonographic evaluation to confirm the biliary etiology. ERCP was performed in all patients on the first available endoscopy list, and endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed in two patients with calculi or dilated common bile duct on ultrasonographic examination. Medical treatment was administered and laparoscopic cholecystectomy was scheduled after 8-12 weeks to allow the inflammatory process to settle. There were no recurrent attacks of pancreatitis during this period. The degree of difficulty of the laparoscopic procedure was assessed by the presence of adhesions to the gallbladder area, difficulty of dissection in the Calot's triangle, intraoperative bleeding and the need for a drain. Six patients (31.5%) had severe adhesions, difficult dissection of the cystic duct and artery, bleeding and prolonged operating time. In two of these patients (10.5%) the procedure was converted to open cholecystectomy. In conclusion, our results suggest that postponing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in acute pancreatitis patients is not advantageous surgically and does not justify the risk of further morbidity caused by the gallbladder disease.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

CD010339|17226043|Ceftriaxone associated nephrolithiasis: a prospective study in 284 children.|Urinary tract calculi have been reported to account for between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 7,600 hospital admissions in children in the USA. The annual incidence of urolithiasis in patients older than 10 years is 109 per 100,000 of the population in men and 36 per 100,000 of the population in women in Minnesota. The use of various medications is considered to be one of the etiologic factors of nephrolithiasis. Ceftriaxone is a widely used third-generation cephalosporin that is generally considered very safe, but complications such as biliary pseudolithiasis, and rarely, nephrolithiasis have been reported in children. There is limited information about urolithiasis as a side effect of ceftriaxone. The aim of this study was evaluation of the incidence of nephrolithiasis following ceftriaxone therapy in children. This quasi-experimental before and after study was conducted in Mofid Children's Hospital between 2003 and 2005. All patients were treated with 75 mg/kg intravenous ceftriaxone. Diagnosis of pyelonephritis was based on standard criteria. The first renal ultrasonography was performed on the first or second day of admission and was repeated on the last day of treatment. We also evaluated complicated patients for the third time with renal ultrasonography 3 months after treatment. Stone-forming patients underwent metabolic kidney stone risk factor evaluation. We evaluated 284 patients with pyelonephritis, 185 girls and 99 boys. The first ultrasonography was normal in all of our patients. On the second ultrasonography renal stones were reported in 4 out of 284 cases (1.4% and CI=0.96-1.83%). Underlying metabolic risk factors could not be identified in stone-forming patients. Follow-up ultrasonography 3 months later was normal. The results of our study suggest that ceftriaxone-treated patients may be at an increased risk of kidney stone formation. Stones passed spontaneously in all affected patients so the use of this effective drug can be safely continued. Close monitoring of ceftriaxone-treated patients with regard to kidney stone formation is recommended.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|2729779|The utility of intraoperative cholangiography with acute cholecystitis.|An increasingly important subset of patients with biliary tract disease are those with acute cholecystitis. The indications for both routine or selective intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) during elective cholecystectomy may not be appropriate for this group. The utility of IOC in the presence of acute cholecystitis was examined. The medical records of 223 patients with histologically confirmed acute cholecystitis were reviewed. Clinical and laboratory criteria included age, sex, white blood cell count (WBC), serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. In 52 (23%) patients, IOC was not attempted and was technically unsuccessful in 15 (7%) patients. IOC was successful in 156 (70%) patients and, of these, six (4%) had a false-positive examination. The remainder are divided into two groups. Group 1 (131 patients) had true-negative IOC, whereas Group 2 (19 patients) had true-positive IOC as evidenced by stone recovery upon surgical exploration. When comparing Group 2 with Group 1, the mean preoperative laboratory values are higher; these differences do not reach statistical significance. Further, within Group 2, five (26%) patients did not demonstrate any clinical or laboratory elevations suggestive of common duct pathology. Thus, in acute cholecystitis, laboratory criteria do not appear to discriminate between the presence or absence of choledocholithiasis. IOC is advocated as an integral component of the operative procedure.|1|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

In 57 consecutive patients both procedures were performed, and in 60 only ultrasonography was used. Although the study was conducted during the initial self-teaching period (regarding ultrasonography) the results show an advantage of this relatively new diagnostic technique. The false positive rate was lower and consequently the predictive value of a positive test was higher for intraoperative ultrasonography. The main benefit would thus be a lower rate of negative common bile duct explorations. Our early results suggest that the general surgeon would need only a short adaptation period to this imaging modality, which would seem to be a valuable alternative to intra-operative cholangiography.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|20590755|Successful endoscopic extraction of a large impacted choledocholithiasis in the ampulla of vater: two interesting cases.|In patients with choledocholithiasis, a stone can sometimes become impacted in the ampulla of Vater, potentially resulting in the complications of acute cholangitis and acute pancreatitis. Endoscopic sphincterotomy and needle knife papillotomy are very effective for the removal of an impacted stone in the ampulla of Vater. Dramatic improvement of the symptoms may be expected if these procedures are performed sufficiently early after the occurrence of the impaction. However, depending on the size, site and situation of the impacted stone, we have often encountered difficulties during endoscopic treatment. We encountered two interesting cases of choledocholithiasis with impaction of large stones in the ampulla of Vater. In Case 1, treatment with radial incisions was added to the usual treatment of needle knife papillotomy, because of the large size of the stone, and the combined treatment was effective. In Case 2, a large periampullary choledochoduodenal fistula was created at the ampulla of Vater, and an indwelling double pigtail tube was placed in the ampulla; the stone then discharged via the tube without additional need for endoscopic sphincterotomy or needle knife papillotomy. Our experience in these cases indicates that innovations in treatment according to the situation of the impacted stone may be needed for the treatment of giant impacted stones in the ampulla of Vater.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The duodenofiberscopic examination with biopsy revealed the cause of obstructive jaundice directly in eight cases, when carcinoma of the pancreas or papilla of Vater extended to the duodenal mucosal surface. In 34 of the 37 patients with choledocholithiasis, ERCP alone was successful in making the diagnosis. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and ERCP were used together to reach a diagnosis in the remaining three patients.

CD011548|1364212|Endoscopic approaches in the diagnosis of obstructive jaundice--with special reference to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.|Duodenofiberscopy with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed in 102 patients with obstructive jaundice. Peritoneoscopy and peritoneoscopic cholecystocholangiography were done in patients whose ERCP was inconclusive. The causes of obstructive jaundice were carcinoma of the pancreas in 14 cases, carcinoma of the papilla of Vater in 12 cases, choledocholithiasis in 37 cases, carcinoma of the common bile duct in seven cases, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in seven cases, intrahepatic cholestasis in three cases and miscellaneous causes in eight cases. No final diagnosis was made in 14 patients. The duodenofiberscopic examination with biopsy revealed the cause of obstructive jaundice directly in eight cases, when carcinoma of the pancreas or papilla of Vater extended to the duodenal mucosal surface. In 34 of the 37 patients with choledocholithiasis, ERCP alone was successful in making the diagnosis.

On two occasions, the examination modified the preoperative diagnosis, diagnosing liver metastasis in a patient with hydatid cysts and in another by detecting gallstones in the main biliary duct in which ERCP was suggestive of an ampullary tumor. Ultrasound made a definitive diagnosis of choledocholithiasis in one case, and pancreatic carcinoma in three cases all of which had a preoperative diagnosis of biliary obstruction of undetermined cause. The examination defined accurately the level of obstruction and the extent of a carcinoma of the bile ducts in two patients and it helped in obtaining cytological samples from a pancreatic tumor mass.

CD010339|20590759|Is nasobiliary drainage unnecessary for drainage of acute suppurative cholangitis? Our experience.|Two randomized controlled trials comparing endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) and internal endoscopic biliary drainage (internal EBD) for acute suppurative cholangitis (ASC) showed no significant difference in efficacy and both preferred internal EBD to ENBD. In this study, the necessity of ENBD was re-examined. Over five years, 59 patients underwent an emergency endoscopic procedure for ASC in our institute. If drainage was needed, we selected internal EBD as a first choice and ENBD was used in patients predicted to have early obstruction of the tube or retrograde infection of the bile duct. The rate of ENBD, for which reason ENBD was selected, and the efficacy of drainage were examined retrospectively. In the 59 patients, 40 patients had the stones completely removed without drainage, five internal EBD and two ENBD were performed without removal of stones and five internal EBD and seven ENBD were performed after removal of stones. In terms of white blood cell count and direct bilirubin level, no significant difference was observed between ENBD and internal EBD patients. ENBD was mainly selected for the patients with multiple biliary strictures, hemorrhage tendency and excessive purulent bile. Even though internal drainage is suitable in many ASC patients, ENBD is necessary in selected patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD009323|8055231|Endoscopic treatment of laparoscopic bile duct injuries.|Laparoscopic technique has become the norm for cholecystectomy, one of the most commonly performed operations. Unfortunately, the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been accompanied by a significant increase in bile duct injuries and a new set of postsurgical problems when compared with traditional, open cholecystectomy. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has emerged as a central method for diagnosis and treatment of bile duct injuries and other problems arising after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The most common biliary problems include bile leaks from the cystic duct remnant or one of the main ducts; ductal injury, such as disruption or strictures; retained common bile duct stones; or postoperative biliary-pancreatic pain. Building on the success of endoscopic treatment of biliary complications of traditional surgery, ERCP, in cooperation with radiological and surgical intervention, can facilitate definitive diagnosis and treatment of bile leaks and simple strictures. Complex strictures and complete disruptions are not amenable to endoscopic therapy and should be treated surgically. As experience in laparoscopic cholecystectomy increases, the incidence of bile duct injuries should decline; ERCP, however, will remain a valuable adjunctive modality.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

In 55 patients we evaluated both clinical: jaundice, pruritus, presence of biliary lithiasis and biochemical parameters: total serum biliary salts (TBS), total bilirubin (TB), alkaline phosphatase (AP), gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), transaminase (AST, ALT), cholesterol (CT), triglycerides (TG), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and compared them with a control group matched for sex and age. In the transplant patients significantly higher values of TBS, TB, AP (p < 0.05) were found; 55% of the patients had above mean values of at least one of the classical parameters of liver function and an higher frequency of biliary lithiasis was also found, in the absence of the classical risk factors. However, none of the patients presented severe signs of hepatic disease and to date it has never been necessary to stop treatment.

In 55 patients we evaluated both clinical: jaundice, pruritus, presence of biliary lithiasis and biochemical parameters: total serum biliary salts (TBS), total bilirubin (TB), alkaline phosphatase (AP), gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), transaminase (AST, ALT), cholesterol (CT), triglycerides (TG), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and compared them with a control group matched for sex and age. In the transplant patients significantly higher values of TBS, TB, AP (p < 0.05) were found; 55% of the patients had above mean values of at least one of the classical parameters of liver function and an higher frequency of biliary lithiasis was also found, in the absence of the classical risk factors. However, none of the patients presented severe signs of hepatic disease and to date it has never been necessary to stop treatment. In conclusion, our study shows that the dosage of CyA used at present is quite safe; however, it is necessary to monitor in these patients some parameters of liver function to prevent the minor side effects we observed from progressing into more serious damage.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones

Gallstones were found more often in cirrhotic patients (29.2%) than in controls (13.6%) (p less than 0.01). Their prevalence increased with age. The ratio of women to men in cirrhotics was the same as in the general population, with a higher prevalence in women. The prevalence of gallstones increased in decompensated liver disease. There was a significantly higher prevalence of both hypersplenism and hemolysis in cirrhosis. No difference was found in gallstone prevalence in relation to cirrhosis etiology. This prospective study confirms, by means of sonography, the high prevalence of cholelithiasis in liver cirrhosis, and extends the previous data about the lithogenic risk factors in this disease.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|2210455|Pancreatic duct abnormalities in gall stone disease: an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic study.|This study was carried out to assess pancreatic duct abnormalities in gall stone disease. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatograms of 50 patients with gall stone disease were analysed and the results compared with those obtained in 33 patients investigated for cholestatic jaundice who were found to have a normal biliary tree (control group). Abnormal pancreatograms were obtained in 24 (48%) patients with gall stone disease and in only two (6%) in the control group; the differences were statistically significant (chi 2 = 14.3; p less than 0.001). The patients in the control group showed mild abnormalities as did those in the gall stone group. The frequency of various abnormalities were: mild 16 (32%), moderate five (10%), and severe three (6%). Pancreatic duct abnormalities were more severe and occurred more frequently in patients with gall stones who had stones in the biliary tree than in patients with a normal biliary tree (postcholecystectomy patients, 55% v 25%) but the difference between the two groups just failed to be significant (chi 2 = 3.34). In conclusion, nearly half of all patients with gall stone disease have pancreatic duct abnormalities and in 16% these were severe enough to be labelled as chronic pancreatitis.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|10149179|Biliary lithotripsy can be enhanced with proper ultrasound probe position.|We have demonstrated in our in vitro system that an extracorporeal lithotripter utilizing a movable ultrasound probe can fragment gallstones more effectively when the ultrasound probe is not partially blocking shock waves. Using a pressure transducer we measured the pressures in the focal volume of a Wolf Piezolith 2300 lithotripter with the ultrasound probe fully extended and fully retracted. We also chose 12 pairs of twin gallstones, each taken from the same gallbladder. One stone from each pair was subjected to shock waves while the ultrasound probe was fully extended and the other treated while the probe was fully retracted. Shock wave pressures (which are converted to a measurable voltage output by our transducer) were clearly lower when the ultrasound probe was extended (5.45 volts; SEM = 0.10 volts) as compared to when the ultrasound scanner was retracted (6.7 volts: SEM = 0.08 volts). Significantly more shock waves were required to completely fragment stones when the ultrasound scanner was extended than when it was retracted (p = 0.01 using the nonparametric Wilcoxon's signed rank test). These results show that, in the lithotripter tested, an extended in-line ultrasound scanner can partially block shock waves. Retraction of an extendible ultrasound probe may enhance stone fragmentation when operating at the highest shock wave intensity.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

After the choledochoscopic cholelithotomy, the combination of absolute ethanol and N-butyl-cyanoacrylate were injected into the diseased biliary duct lumen. Two months later, their T-tube cholangiography demonstrated that the targeted biliary ducts were completely embolized, thus effectively preventing the calculous recurrence.

Presenting symptoms were abdominal pain (217), jaundice (74), cholangitis (38) and external biliary fistula (eight). Fifteen patients also had a t-tube in situ. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was successfully performed in 239 patients and revealed abnormal findings in 179. These included: stones (89), strictures (53), choledochoduodenal fistula (10), choledochal cyst (three), biloma (three), ligation of bile duct (five), ascaris in bile duct (three), pancreatitis (nine), long cystic duct stump (11), and various other findings. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was carried out in 59 patients with stones. Seven patients with strictures were managed with stents. Ascaris in the bile duct of three patients was removed with the help of a Dormia basket.

Endoscopic sphincterotomy was carried out in 59 patients with stones. Seven patients with strictures were managed with stents. Ascaris in the bile duct of three patients was removed with the help of a Dormia basket. To conclude, stones and strictures are common postcholecystectomy problems and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is very helpful in the diagnosis and management of postcholecystectomy patients.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones

The related standard radiologic procedures are preoperative ultrasonography (US) and preoperative cholangiography (PCA). In a retrospective study of 214 patients scheduled for LC over a 2-year period we have reviewed the radiologic and clinical records. Preoperative US revealed stones in the common bile duct (CBD) in 8 patients, all treated with endoscopic papillotomy before or after operation. PCA was successful in 176 patients (82%) and gave crucial information in 22 patients including 8 with stones in the CBD not preoperatively diagnosed, 6 with anomalous anatomy, and 8 with malpositioned surgical clip on the cystic duct. In 26 patients LC was converted into open surgery, but in only one case due to CBD stone revealed at PCA. Seventeen patients had minor postoperative complications, all managed conservatively.

CD010339|12165836|Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a patient with situs inversus totalis and previous abdominal surgery.|Situs inversus totalis is a rare congenital defect that can present difficulties during laparoscopic surgery due to the mirror-image anatomy. We report a patient with symptomatic cholelithiasis and previous abdominal surgery in whom a chest X-ray revealed a right-sided heart, whereas abdominal ultrasound revealed that his gallbladder was located in the left hypochondrium. At surgery, the surgeon and the camera assistant were standing on the right-hand side of the patient, and the first assistant was standing on the left. The camera was introduced through an umbilical incision, and laparoscopy confirmed the situs inversus. The other 10-mm trocar was placed in the midline left of the falciform ligament and two 5-mm trocars were placed in the left subcostal midclavicular line and anterior axillary line, respectively. After dissection of multiple adhesions caused by previous abdominal surgery, a standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed successfully. This report suggests that situs inversus is not a contraindication for laparoscopic surgery. However, the procedure is more difficult and potentially hazardous due to the mirror-image anatomy (particularly the transposition of biliary ducts) causing difficulties in orientation, so that extreme care is required to avoid iatrogenic injuries. Despite these factors, laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely in patients with situs inversus totalis.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

In our study, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in 12 cirrhotic patients (eight Child A and four Child B) in an effort to obtain lower complication and mortality rates. The mean age of the group was 51.8 years; seven of the 12 patients were men. Four patients had liver disease from virus B, five from virus C, one because of alcohol, and two had cryptogenic liver cirrhosis. The average operative time was 157 min. Intraoperative cholangiography could be performed in eight cases. No mortality or need to perform laparotomy occurred. Only one patient required blood transfusion (8.3%). Postoperative complications occurred in four patients, but these were easily controlled and included renal failure, diabetic impairment, hematoma with ascitic leakage through the wound, and wound abscess, one case each. No postoperative liver failure was observed. All patients walked and were refed in the first 24 h after surgery. They were dismissed in an average period of 2.5 days. Our primary view demonstrated that laparoscopic cholecystectomy was safe and well tolerated by selected cirrhotic patients (Child A and B) with clear indication for surgery.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|8119640|Indications for surgical treatment of acute pancreatitis.|The clinical spectrum of acute pancreatitis ranges from mild, self-limiting symptoms to fulminant illness that may rapidly lead to multiple organ failure and death. Differentiation between acute interstitial pancreatitis, necrotizing pancreatitis, pancreatic abscess and acute pseudocyst is mandatory for the choice of surgical treatment. If morphological evaluation by dynamic pancreatography reveals pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis, bacteriological evaluation by CT-guided fine-needle aspiration is the mainstay of further decision-making, and should be performed if general signs of inflammation are not improved by conservative therapy. Basically, operative treatment may be directed against underlying pathology (e.g. cholelithiasis), or may aim to manage complications. Infected necrosis is the only clear indication for surgery. Whether the choice should be debridement and gravity drainage, continuous closed lavage of the lesser sac, staged relaparotomies, or open packing, depends on the extent of the process and the individual situation. Peripancreatic fluid collections and pancreatic pseudocysts without major ductal pathology rarely need operative treatment in the early stages, whereas abscesses resulting from infected necrosis should be dealt with by surgery rather than by percutaneous drainage.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

We decided to assess if preoperative criteria such as history, clinical examination or laboratory findings could be used for selective indication for preoperative IVC. In a series of 146 patients with a preoperative IVC before undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, history, clinical findings and laboratory results (bilirubin, transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, amylase) have been correlated with the radiological findings. ERCP was taken as the standard to assess the value of IVC. A normal IVC was quite reliable in excluding any pathology of the bile ducts or common bile duct stones. Thus specificity reached 96% and the negative predictive value was 97%. On the other hand a pathological IVC proved not to be a valid predictor of true pathological alterations. Sensitivity was only 60% and the positive predictive value just 55%. Over all accuracy was quite satisfactory (94%). We could not find a correlation between history, clinical or laboratory findings and the final result as assessed by ERCP. Therefore we could not find any useful parameters to define a selective policy for indication of preoperative IVC. On the other hand the IVC still proved useful to exclude relevant pathological findings.

Patients were operated on between 1970 and 1990, with a later follow-up in 1993. The pathogenesis of stone formation, in these cases, was relatable to multiple factors: biliary infection, presence of lithogenic nuclei (e.g. foreign bodies such as suture stitches), biliary stasis due to the stenosis. Management of this peculiar disease must take into account both surgical options and percutaneous as well as endoscopic methods. Our approach is the reconstruction of the stenotic anastomosis at its highest point, associated with intraoperative lithotomy followed by post-operative lithotomy and lithotripsy (if necessary) using PTCS (percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy). The best results are achieved with cooperation between surgeon, radiologist and endoscopist, aimed at preventing post-operative complications and severe consequences for the patient.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

We undertook the present study with two objectives: (i) to investigate the possible physiochemical and radiological differences between cholesterol gallstones obtained from Indian and German patients; and (ii) to compare the brittleness of the two stone groups. Forty Indian and 36 German gallstones (matched in size and shape) were subjected to assessment of physical characteristics, in vitro computed tomography (CT) and chemical analysis. German stones more often had a stone density distribution index of > or = 50 Hounsfield units (HU) (26 vs 14; P < 0.01), peripheral calcification (18 vs 9; P < 0.02), maximum CT density > or = 90 HU (17 vs 9; P < 0.05) and significant calcium carbonate (9 vs 5; P < 0.05), compared to Indian stones. The in vitro lithotripsy performed with the Siemens Lithostar Plus machine at a constant energy level showed the German stones to be more brittle (easy to fragment), more often requiring < 1000 shocks for fragmentation (25/36; 69%) compared to Indian stones (18/40; 45%, P < 0.05).

Gallstones from different geographic regions may show significant variations in their physicochemical characteristics that may explain the differences in their brittleness to lithotripsy.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones
CD010339|8273006|Technique of ultrasound examination during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.|Intracorporeal ultrasonography was used as a new method to examine the bile ducts during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A prototype rigid 7.5-MHz ultrasound probe, 10 mm in diameter and 50 cm in length, was introduced during 25 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. A dual scanning technique was developed for complete examination of the bile duct. This entailed transverse scanning via the subxyphoid trocar and longitudinal scanning via the umbilical trocar. The intrahepatic ducts were also visualized by placing the probe on the liver surface. Color Doppler imaging was useful to quickly distinguish the duct from vascular structures. Laparoscopic ultrasonography clearly delineated the bile ducts in all operations except one. The time required for imaging was significantly shorter for ultrasonography than for cholangiography. Our preliminary experience demonstrates that a complete examination of the bile ducts can be performed with intracorporeal ultrasonography in a relatively short period of time.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|2565606|Comparison of methods for transcatheter fragmentation of gallstones.|Alternative methods have been considered for treating cholelithiasis. Compared to extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL), a percutaneous endoscopic approach would be more invasive, but would offer the advantage of immediate stone removal without the need for subsequent drug therapy. We performed an in vitro comparison of three methods of transcatheter cholecystolithotripsy with regard to effectiveness of stone fragmentation, damage to the gallbladder mucosa, and compatibility with percutaneous delivery systems. The three devices used for cholecystolithotripsy were the ultrasonic lithotriptor (UL), the electrohydraulic lithotriptor (EHL), and the thulium-holmium-chromium: YAG laser (THC:YAG). The UL effectively fragmented all types of stones studied, although it is necessary to hold the stone against the tip of the probe. The EHL quickly fragmented noncalcified and pigment stones simply by placing the tip in the vicinity of the stone, but calcified stones had to be held in position near the electrode. The THC:YAG was effective at fragmenting each type of stone, but the number of pulses required was quite large, corresponding to 7 min for some stones. The EHL had the most capacity for mucosal damage, followed by the THC:YAG laser. The UL produced no mucosal damage at the exposure times tested. The UL is not compatible with flexible endoscopes while the EHL and the THC:YAG are. Because of the specific advantages and disadvantages of each device, a combination of devices may be required for successful clinical cholecystolithotripsy.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

We herein present the results of ERCP for patients with a Roux-en-Y anastomosis using a double-balloon endoscope. Six patients (six men with a mean age of 69 years) who had undergone prior gastric resection with Roux-en-Y reconstruction were enrolled in the present study and underwent ERCP and associated procedures. ERCP was carried out with a double balloon endoscope, which has one balloon attached to the tip of the endoscope and another attached to the distal end of the soft overtube. In all patients, entering the Y loop was successfully accomplished, and the papilla of Vater was also reached in all cases (100%). Cannulation was successful in four patients (66.7%). The final diagnosis was choledocholithiasis in two patients, biliary fistula in one patient and pancreatic cancer in one patient. A needle-knife precut papillotomy was carried out after placement of a bile duct stent in two patients, and injection of N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate into a biliary fistula was carried out in one patient. None of the patients suffered from any complications. A double balloon endoscope is therefore considered to be useful for carrying out ERCP and associated procedures in patients with a Roux-en-Y anastomosis.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Studies were identified using a MEDLINE computer search followed by an extensive manual search. The inclusion criteria used were: randomized trial, radiolucent gallstones in a visualizing gallbladder on oral cholecystography, and complete stone dissolution confirmed by oral cholecystography or ultrasound. Study results were pooled into 6 groups: placebo: high- and low-dose chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (> or = 10 mg.kg/day and < 10 mg.kg/day); high- and low-dose ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (> or = 7 mg.kg/day and < 7 mg.kg/day) and combined CDCA plus UDCA. Homogeneity calculations were performed and the percentage of complete stone dissolution calculated for each group with 95% confidence intervals. Of 66 trials identified, 23 comprising 1949 patients met the inclusion criteria. A total of 1062 patients were treated with CDCA, 819 with UDCA and 78 combination therapy. In studies > 6 months' duration, high-dose UDCA completely dissolved stones in 37.3% of patients (95% C.I. 33-42%), low-dose UDCA in 20.6%) and high-dose CDCA 18.2% (95% C.I. 15-21%). Based on only two studies, combination therapy achieved dissolution in 62.8% (95% C.I. 51-74%) of patients. Stones less than 10 mm dissolved significantly more frequently than stones larger than 10 mm. This analysis shows that UDCA in doses greater than 7 mg.kg/day taken for greater than 6 months will dissolve radiolucent gallstones in 38% of patients. The combination of UDCA and CDCA may be more efficacious but this observation is based upon only 78 patients and requires confirmation in further randomized trials.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD011549|17939195|[Contact chemical litholysis of gallbladder stones with methyl tert-butyl ether. Personal experience].|The purpose of the work is to estimate the efficiency and follow-ups of the contact chemical litholysis (CCL) of gallstones with methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The CCL has been carried to 5 women with plural (10-15) radiolucent gallstones, who refused from cholecystectomy. The percutaneous transhepatic puncture of the gallbladder has been executed to them under X-ray and ultrasonic control. Laboratory (general blood analysis, urine analysis, biochemical parameters of blood and bile) and tool (ultrasonic control, cholecystography) researches were carried out before the procedure, during dissolution, 2, 6, 9 months after the CCL. High litholytic activity of MTBE has been revealed by dissolution of cholesterol stones of the gallbladder with use of the above-mentioned agent.

In the normal cases, the common hepatic duct remained the same or decreased in caliber. Abnormal responses consisted of a normal-caliber duct that increased in size or a slightly dilated duct that remained the same or increased in size. By employing these criteria, we discovered patients with ampullary stenosis, common duct stones, cholangiocarcinoma, and chronic pancreatitis.

The bile was infected by E. coli and the biliary ducts were dilated; in addition, extrahepatic bile-pigment calculi were present in all 5 and intrahepatic calculi in 4. Abdominal ultrasound usually failed to demonstrate duct calculi and extrahepatic dilatation due to the soft, mud-like consistency of the stones. CT was successful in showing the calculi and the full extent of dilatation. The authors conclude that preoperative diagnosis of RPC is best achieved by awareness of the characteristic clinical presentation and the findings on abdominal CT.

Preoperative or postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was performed whenever stones were suspected clinically. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was performed in 44 patients (11%), in whom 14 (3.5%) had an endoscopic sphincterotomy with extraction of common bile duct stones. Intraoperative cholangiography was performed in only eight patients (2%) almost exclusively to acquire experience with the technique, and all cholangiograms were normal. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully completed in 96% of the patients. There were no deaths in this series, and major complications occurred in only 5% of patients. Two patients (0.5%) had a significant common bile duct injury that was recognized and successfully repaired at the initial operation. No late common bile duct strictures have been recognized. Six patients (1.5%) underwent postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography for suspected common bile duct stones, with three patients requiring endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction. This experience suggests that the use of preoperative and postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography can be based on clinical presentation and laboratory evaluation and does not need to be performed routinely.

However, the incidence of carcinoma in those with diameters greater than 1 cm was 23%, a lower rate than expected from previous pathological studies. Comparison of ultrasonographic and actual measurements suggested that the size of cholesterol polyps tended to be overestimated by ultrasonography, suggesting that the apparent risk of cancer was decreased by cholesterol polyps.

In this literature we describe different physiopathological mechanisms of lithiasis after gastric bypass by coeliosurgery or gastroplasty, their diagnosis, and preventive treatment to avoid these complications.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones

A recently developed second generation shock wave source (Siemens-Lithostar, Erlangen, FRG) generates shock waves electromagnetically. It presents several novel features. In particular the waterbath can be omitted and due to lower shock wave pressure general anaesthesia is not required. In vitro studies showed that 36 out of 38 gallstones (11-30 mm in diameter) could be disintegrated. Two concrements resisting lithotripsy were pure white cholesterol stones. Independent of shape, size, and composition (cholesterol or pigment) the maximum diameter of remaining fragments after lithotripsy was between 1 and 8 mm.

CD010339|10545591|Congenital transmission of visceral leishmaniasis (Kala Azar) from an asymptomatic mother to her child.|In this article, we report the case of a 16-month-old German boy who was admitted to the Children's Hospital of Stuttgart with a 4-week history of intermittent fever, decreased appetite, weakness, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping. He was healthy at birth and remained so for the first 15 months of his life. On admission, physical examination showed enlarged cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes, as well as hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory data revealed pancytopenia, elevated liver function tests, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Blood, stool, and urine culture results were negative. Viral infections and rheumatologic and autoimmune disorders were ruled out, but a positive titer for Leishmania antibodies was noted. In a liver and bone marrow biopsy, the amastigote form of the parasite could not be seen in cells. The promastigote form of Leishmania was found and the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis was made by combining the cultures of both the liver and the bone marrow biopsy material in 5 mL 0.9% saline on brain heart infusion agar, supplemented with defibrinated rabbit blood and incubated at 25 to 26 degrees C for 5 days. The parasite was identified by Southern blot analysis as Leishmania infantum. Specific therapy with the antimonial compound sodium stibogluconate with a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight was begun immediately. Within 4 days, the patient became afebrile. The side effects of treatment, including erosive gastritis, cholelithiasis, worsening hepatosplenomegaly, elevation of liver enzymes, pancreatitis, and electrocardiogram abnormalities, necessitated the discontinuation of treatment after 17 days. On discharge 4 weeks later, the patient was stabilized and afebrile with a normal spleen, normal complete blood count, normal gammaglobulins, and decreasing antibody titers to Leishmania. During the next 24 months, the patient experienced intermittent episodes of abdominal pain, decreased appetite, recurrent arthralgia, and myalgia. But at his last examination in January 1998, he was well; all symptoms mentioned above had disappeared. Because the child had never left Germany, nonvector transmission was suspected and household contacts were examined. His mother was the only one who had a positive antibody titer against Leishmania donovani complex. She had traveled several times to endemic Mediterranean areas (Portugal, Malta, and Corse) before giving birth to the boy. But she had never been symptomatic for visceral leishmaniasis. Her bone marrow, spleen, and liver biopsy results were within normal limits. Culture results and polymerase chain reaction of this material were negative. A Montenegro skin test result was positive, indicating a previous infection with Leishmania. Western blot analysis showed specific recognition by maternal antibodies of antigens of Leishmania cultured from the boy's tissue. Visceral leishmaniasis is endemic to several tropical and subtropical countries, but also to the Mediterranean region. It is transmitted by the sand fly (Phlebotomus, Lutzomyia). Occasional nonvector transmissions also have been reported through blood transfusions, sexual intercourse, organ transplants, excrements of dogs, and sporadically outside endemic areas. Only 8 cases of congenital acquired disease have been described before 1995, when our case occurred. In our patient, additional evaluation showed that the asymptomatic mother must have had a subclinical infection with Leishmania that was reactivated by pregnancy, and then congenitally transmitted to the child. Visceral leishmaniasis has to be considered in children with fever, pancytopenia, and splenomegaly, even if the child has not been to an endemic area and even if there is no evidence of the disease in his environment, because leishmaniasis can be transmitted congenitally from an asymptomatic mother to her child.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

This study was conducted to present our experience. In the period 1982-90, 1089 cases of calculous and acalculous gallbladder disease were treated in our clinic. In this period, 27 patients were subjected to cholecystectomy because of an acalculous, non inflamed gallbladder which was elongated lying in an abnormal position with a long cystic duct. The mean duration of symptoms supportive of cholelithiasis, was 5 years. Oral cholecystogram and ultrasonography led to the diagnosis and other causes of chronic abdominal pain were excluded. There were 13 lumbar, 9 pelvic and 5 iliac gallbladders, with poor function in 20 of them. During cholecystectomy, the organ was invested by peritoneum and suspended in 7 cases from a mesentery. On pathological examination mild chronic inflammation was reported in 19 cases and minimal changes in 8. The minimum follow up was one year and the maximum 9 years. Complete relief of symptoms was achieved in all the cases. In conclusion, cholecystectomy should be offered in these symptomatic ""hanging"" gallbladders."|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|3547719|The importance of early diagnosis of acute acalculus cholecystitis.|Most observations of acute acalculus cholecystitis have been reported in patients after trauma, after unrelated surgical treatment and in critically ill patients, patient populations in whom the diagnosis of this condition is difficult. The importance of making an early diagnosis is demonstrated by the rapid development of complicated forms of cholecystitis. The results of collective reports have indicated that 40 to 100 per cent of the patients with acute acalculus cholecystitis will have advanced disease with gangrene, empyema or perforation of the gallbladder at operation. To demonstrate the importance of early suspicion and the use of sonography in making the diagnosis of this condition, a retrospective study of 40 patients with a surgical and pathologic proved diagnosis of acute acalculus cholecystitis was conducted. The fulminant nature of this disease was underscored by the fact that 70 per cent of these patients had advanced disease. Patients were divided into two groups, those who underwent operation within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms and those whose surgical treatment was delayed. Forty per cent of the patients who underwent operation more than 48 hours after the onset of symptoms had gallbladder perforation, while only 8 per cent of the patients without a delay in surgical treatment of more than 48 hours had perforations. Since advanced disease, especially perforation, carries a much higher morbidity and mortality than uncomplicated cholecystitis, making an early diagnosis is of paramount importance. Therefore, heightened awareness on the part of physicians is a key in making an early diagnosis. In 25 per cent of the patients in this study, unexplained fever was the first sign of the disease. Although most patients later presented with more classic symptoms of cholecystitis, many of these patients still presented with confusing clinical signs and symptoms leading to a delay in diagnosis due to the coexistence of the post-trauma, postsurgical or critically ill state. Ultrasound proved to be an important adjunct to the often confusing clinical clues in making an early diagnosis. Three ultrasonographic signs in the absence of stones--1, a thickened gallbladder wall; 2, an enlarged tender gallbladder, and 3, a pericholecystic collection--were suggestive of acute acalculus cholecystitis. One of these findings was present in almost 90 per cent of the patients in this study with acute acalculus cholecystitis who underwent biliary ultrasound.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7890216|Composition of gall bladder stones associated with octreotide: response to oral ursodeoxycholic acid.|Octreotide, an effective treatment for acromegaly, induces gall bladder stones in 13-60% of patients. Because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention, this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 octreotide treated acromegalic patients with gall stones. Chemical analysis of gall stones retrieved at cholecystectomy from two patients, showed that they contained 71% and 87% cholesterol by weight. In the remaining 12 patients, localised computed tomography of the gall bladder showed that eight had stones with maximum attenuation scores of < 100 Hounsfield units (values of < 100 HU predict cholesterol rich, dissolvable stones). Gall bladder bile was obtained by ultrasound guided, fine needle puncture from six patients. All six patients had supersaturated bile (mean (SEM) cholesterol saturation index of 1.19 (0.08) (range 1.01-1.53)) and all had abnormally rapid cholesterol microcrystal nucleation times (< 4 days (range 1-4)), whilst in four, the bile contained cholesterol microcrystals immediately after sampling. Of the 12 patients considered for oral ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment, two had a blocked cystic duct and were not started on UDCA while one was lost to follow up. After one year of treatment, five of the remaining nine patients showed either partial (n = 3) or complete (n = 2) gall stone dissolution, suggesting that their stones were cholesterol rich. This corresponds, by actuarial (life table) analysis, to a combined gall stone dissolution rate of 58.3 (15.9%). In conclusion, octreotide induced gall stones are generally small, multiple, and cholesterol rich although, in common with spontaneous gall stone disease, at presentation some patients will have a blocked cystic duct and some gall stones containing calcium.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|8797971|MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) at 0.5 T: technique optimisation and preliminary results.|The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility of MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) at 0.5 T. To our knowledge no previous studies of MRCP have been performed at mid-field strength. Thirty-one patients with dilated biliary systems were examined with three-dimensional MRCP. All patients were studied with a 0.5 T superconducting magnet. A three-dimensional turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequence was acquired (TR = 5000 ms, TE = 244 ms, echo train length = 45; acquisition time = 14 min 10 s). Coronal images were post-processed with the MIP algorithm. Recently, the parameters have been optimised (TR = 3000 ms, TE = 700 ms, echo train length = 128), reducing the acquisition time to 3 min. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed in 26 cases; 5 patients underwent percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography PTC. MRCP and ERCP images were evaluated by an experienced radiologist and an endoscopist. MRCP of diagnostic quality was acquired in all patients. Choledocholithiasis was correctly evaluated by MRCP in 12 of 12 patients, compared with 11 correct diagnoses by ERCP. The presence and the level of the stricture were accurately shown in 16 of 16 patients with MRCP and in 13 of 16 patients with ERCP. The peripheral biliary tree above the obstruction and pancreatic duct were better evaluated by MRCP in all cases. In 3 of 3 patients who had undergone bilio-enteric surgery, a correct evaluation of the site of the anastomosis was possible with MRCP. It is concluded that MRCP performed at mid-field strength allows good visualisation of the dilated biliary system. Excellent results have been obtained on comparison with ERCP. MRCP performed at mid-field strength could have the same clinical value as high field strength MRCP.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|8257628|Bile duct disruption after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.|The reported prevalence of biliary tract disruption following laparoscopic cholecystectomy has ranged from 0% to 7% in early reports. We have reviewed the first 823 laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed at our institution and found 13 symptomatic biliary complications necessitating further therapy (prevalence 1.6%). This finding represents a decrease from the 2.7% prevalence found in our earlier series. The incidence of biliary complications will likely continue to vary depending on patient selection, operator experience, and new developments in laparoscopic technique. Bile duct injury and bile leaks are often difficult to diagnose but must be strongly considered in postoperative patients with abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, or continued bilious drainage from a surgical drain. Whereas computed tomography (CT) and sonography are sensitive in detecting perihepatic or free peritoneal fluid collections, they are nonspecific and definitive diagnosis of biliary tract injury requires hepatobiliary scintigraphy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), or percutaneous aspiration.

CD010339|8405868|Biliary papillomatosis with the point mutation of K-ras gene arising in congenital choledochal cyst.|Biliary papillomatosis is a rare entity. A case of biliary papillomatosis associated with congenital choledochal cyst and intrahepatic gallstones is reported here. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy revealed multiple papillary lesions of the right intrahepatic duct and the common bile duct. Microscopically, the papillary mucosal lesion showed papillary proliferations of bile duct epithelial cells with mild atypia. Furthermore, a point mutation at codon 12 of the K-ras oncogene was found in the papillary lesion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of biliary papillomatosis arising in congenital choledochal cyst. Although the pathogenesis of biliary papillomatosis in our case was unclear, biliary irritation associated with choledochal cyst may be related to biliary papillomatosis with point mutation at codon 12 of K-ras gene.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

A total of 80 lithotripsies was conducted in 60 patients with radiotransparent+ stones measuring 25 mm on the average. Up to 3,000 pulsating-wave discharges were prescribed (a total of 2 sessions), which were generated by an underwater spark discharge. All of the stones were crushed. The stone fragments were dissolved by means of xeno and ursodeoxycholic acid (7-8 mg/kg daily). Ultrasonographic control 3 months after lithotripsy showed absence of stones in 29 patients (31.6%). The stone fragments disappeared completely in 15 (60%) in a group of 25 patients with solitary stones.

CD010339|285682|Ultrasound tomography of the liver: Non-invasive method of choice for the differential diagnosis of jaundice.|Grey-scale ultrasound tomography was used to examine the liver and biliary tree of 100 consecutive unselected jaundiced patients in a prospective study. It was successful in differentiating between hepato-cellular and obstructive jaundice in 94%. It precisely localised the site of obstruction in 75% of those patients with enlargement of the head of the pancreas from either carcinoma or gall-stones impacted in the Ampulla of Vater. This figure was reduced to 60% when all cases of obstruction were considered. Cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis were found to be associated with an abnormal pattern of echoes within the liver. These echoes were stronger and more numerous than normal. This association was not apparent with drug-induced cholestasis or acute viral hepatitis. Grey-scale ultrasound tomography is quick, safe and completely non-invasive. It should be the initial investigation of choice in the differential diagnosis of jaundice. When precise localisation of an obstruction is not possible after a repeat attempt, then percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography should be considered.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|1831957|Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: 111 consecutive cases.|Laparoscopic cholecystectomy removes the gallbladder through three or four puncture wounds in the abdominal wall. The technique reduces the recuperative time to full activity, from as long as 4 wk to as little as 3 days, compared with conventional cholecystectomy. We herein present our initial experience with this procedure. In this series of 111 laparoscopic cholecystectomies, there were no mortalities and only one morbidity. Thirty-nine patients (35%) had a history of prior abdominal surgery. Fourteen underwent laparoscopic lysis of adhesions. Intraoperative cholangiograms were performed in 24 patients (21%), demonstrating choledocholithiasis in three. Two of the three patients underwent postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP); in the other, laparoscopic common bile duct exploration was performed. In each case, the common bile duct (CBD) was completely cleared of stones. Incidental laparoscopic appendectomy was also performed in three patients. The average time for completion of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in cases of chronic cholecystitis was 40 min. If the gallbladder was acutely inflamed, the procedure took a mean of 126 min. This series had a higher percentage of patients (19%) with acute cholecystitis then previously reported; therefore, the 2% conversion rate in this series emphasizes the broad applicability of the technique. The average length of stay in the hospital was 1.4 days, and patients returned to work in about 7 days.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|15998480|[Pneumobilia. A case report].|Pneumobilia, gas within the biliary tract, is due to an abnormal connection between the gastrointestinal tract and the biliary tract and is considered a serious pathology usually requiring surgical intervention. Most cases of pneumobilia are related to gallstone disease, and spontaneous biliary-enteric fistula is reported to be the most common cause of pneumobilia. Another well-documented cause of pneumobilia is a surgically created anastomosis between the biliary tract and the bowel, the Whipple procedure, and choledocho-jejunostomy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with papillosphincterotomy or surgical transduodenal sphincteroplasty. Transient incompetence of the sphincter of Oddi, gas-forming infections, and trauma have also been reported to cause pneumobilia. We present the case of a 74-year-old woman with asymptomatic cholelithiasis, pneumobilia and cholecystoduodenal fistula treated with cholecystectomy, fistula closure with Graham patch, Stamm-Kader gastrostomy and needle catheter jejunostomy. On the first postoperative day she developed a biliary duodenal fistula that required nutritional support with parenteral, enteral nutrition and octreotide acetate with fistula closure 2 weeks later. We review the etiology, surgical treatment and economic burden. Laparoscopic cholecysto-fistulectomy by skilled laparoscopic surgeons can be adopted as a first-choice treatment for cholecystoduodenal fistula to reduce morbility risks and costs.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Under these conditions, the gallbladder should be opened peripherally, stones extracted, and a cholangiogram performed to assess the situation. Treatment consists of partial cholecystectomy and closure of a cuff of gallbladder wall over a T tube placed into the main bile duct through the fistula.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones

Unresorbable suture material which provokes foreign body granulomas should be avoided in operations upon the biliary tract since, together with even a normal nerve under pressure, it may cause biliary distress. For the same reason, special attention should be devoted to careful trimming of the cystic nerve in cholecystectomy, and ligation or cautery of nerve tissues should be avoided. The cystic duct remnant is more often visualized in peroperative cholangiography than in an intravenous examination but even then not unfailingly.

All patients were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (8-10 mg/kg/day) for 12 months and followed up by ultrasound. In group 1, dissolution was complete in 50% of the patients and partial in a further 20%. In group 2 patients, complete dissolution was not observed but 33% showed partial dissolution. The number of patients with total dissolution at 12 months was significantly higher in group 1 compared with group 2 (p less than 0.02).

These results suggest that computed tomography can be used to select patients with a better likelihood of successful stone dissolution after bile acid therapy.|0|Ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosis of common bile duct stones
CD011549|1612490|Computed tomography in predicting gall stone solubility: a prospective trial.|This prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the correlation between densitometric values of gall stones assessed by computed tomography and the success rate of litholytic therapy in 28 patients eligible for oral treatment. A densitometric study of the stones was performed in all patients before treatment. A cut off point of 60 Hounsfield units (HU) was chosen to divide the subjects into two groups--group 1, 14 patients with low density stones (less than 60 HU) and group 2, 14 patients with high density stones (greater than 60 HU). All patients were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (8-10 mg/kg/day) for 12 months and followed up by ultrasound. In group 1, dissolution was complete in 50% of the patients and partial in a further 20%. In group 2 patients, complete dissolution was not observed but 33% showed partial dissolution. The number of patients with total dissolution at 12 months was significantly higher in group 1 compared with group 2 (p less than 0.02).

CD010339|8338285|Laparoscopic cholecystectomy bile duct injuries: more than meets the eye.|Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has rapidly become standard treatment of symptomatic cholelithiasis. Its advantages are well known, while its risks have not been well defined. The most common major complication of LC is bile duct injury. Over the past year, we have treated six patients for this problem. Injuries included: one partial laceration of the common bile duct; one partial laceration of the common hepatic duct; three complete common hepatic duct transections at the bifurcation, and one clip obstruction of the right hepatic duct. Intraoperative cholangiography was performed in two of six patients. Injury was recognized in these two cases, which were converted to celiotomy for immediate repair. One was repaired primarily; the other required a hepaticojejunostomy. Injuries were not identified at LC in four. Three of the four patients required biliary-enteric reconstruction procedures. With a mean follow-up period of 13 months, four of six patients remain symptomatic. LC does carry a real risk of bile duct injury. Routine intraoperative cholangiography may decrease this risk or at least allow early recognition and repair when it has occurred. Conversion to an open procedure is not a complication of LC but rather a sign of good surgical judgement. Patients not following the routine postoperative course must be evaluated for a possible bile duct injury to prevent the morbidity of delayed diagnosis.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Total 31 patients aged 25-55 with biliary sediment in lumens of their gall-bladders (a general group) and 5 healthy patients (a control group) were studied by us. In all cases the markers of the virus of Hepatitis B in blood serum were determined and ultrasonic examination of gall-bladder was carried out by us prior to the duodenal intubation. B-portion was subjected to bacteriological research for aerobes and anaerobs, and pH and kinematic viscosity (eta=mm(2)/sec) were determined. The patients from the control as well as from the general group after a 7-hour period were redetermined pH and Kinematic viscosity of B-portion. Kinematic viscosity was determined with a capillary viscosimeter, and pH was fixed by a method of potentiometer. Statistical treatment was undertaken by the method of ANOLA p<0,05. During the duodenal intubation the mean value of pH within the control group was fixed at 6.74, and the mean value of the kinematic viscosity was 1.34, and after a 7-hour period the same indicators constituted 6.87 and 1.35 mm(2)/sec, respectively. The same indicators within the general group during duodenal intubation were the following: 7.26 and 1.99 mm(2)/sec, and after a 7-hour period the same indicators were 7.78 and 2.19 mm(2)/sec, respectively. There was a significant statistical difference between the mean values of pH and kinematic viscosity of the contents of gall-bladder of the patients from the control and general groups. During a 7-hour period, there was also a significant statistical difference between the changes of the same indicators. The difference was even greater in case of infection. Following the above-mentioned we can conclude that in case of sediment in the lumen of gall-bladder, inclination of pH to alkalinity and increase in kinematic viscosity of the contents is one of the most important criteria of lithogenicity of gall-bladder contents, and one of the reasons for such changes is chronic infection of a gall-bladder.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|21846989|Incidence of bactobilia increases over time after endoscopic sphincterotomy.|Patients with choledochocystolithiasis are usually treated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography with endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). LC after ES is more difficult than in uncomplicated gallstone disease, possibly due to bacterial colonization of the common bile duct. The goal of this study was to evaluate if bactobilia influences the peri- and postoperative outcomes. Data were obtained from a randomized trial on the timing of LC after ES. Ninety-six patients were randomized after ES to LC either within 72 h (early LC [ELC]) or in 6-8 weeks (delayed LC [DLC]). In 64 of 96 patients bile samples were obtained peroperatively. The overall prevalence of bactobilia was 62.5% [40/64; 50% of ELC patients (n = 13) vs. 71.1% in the DLC group (n = 27); p = 0.088]. Age and group (i.e. ELC/DLC) were independent and significant predictors for the presence of bactobilia. The presence of bactobilia did not influence operating time and difficulty or conversion rate. Patients with bactobilia developed more biliary events in the period between ES and LC (44 vs. 28%). After ES for choledochocystolithiasis, 62.5% of patients have bactobilia at the time of surgery. The prevalence of bactobilia increases with age and time.

CD010339|8421099|Prospective study of the long-term effects of somatostatin analog (octreotide) on gallbladder function and gallstone formation in Chinese acromegalic patients.|This article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 Chinese patients with active acromegaly treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog octreotide in dosages of 300-1500 micrograms/day for a mean of 24.2 +/- 13.9 months. During treatment with octreotide, 17 patients developed sludge, 10 had gallstones, and 1 developed acute cholecystitis requiring surgery. In all of 7 patients examined acutely, gallbladder contractility was inhibited after a single 100-micrograms injection. In 8 patients followed for 24 weeks, gallbladder contractility remained depressed throughout therapy. After withdrawal of octreotide in 10 patients without gallstones, 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month. In 8 of the remaining 10 patients who developed gallstones during treatment, gallbladder contractility normalized in 5 patients (3 of whom has disappearance of their stones within 3 weeks), and remained depressed in 3 (2 of whom had stones present at 6 months). Our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge, gallstones, and cholecystitis during octreotide therapy in Chinese acromegalic patients. It is therefore very important to follow the changes of gallbladder function during long-term octreotide therapy of acromegalic patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Our results of 35 case studies, correlating with results from endoscopic, percutaneous cholangiopancreatography or laparotomy, showed that MRCP performed using the half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo (HASTE) sequences was fast and accurate for depiction of the biliary and pancreatic system, with a diagnostic value comparable to that of direct cholangiography. The presence of biliary obstruction was accurately diagnosed in all but one patient. In hilar strictures, MR cholangiogram was able to depict the intrahepatic biliary tree proximal to the level of obstruction which was not readily displayed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (Figs. 1 & 2). This overview of the entire biliary system was found to be advantageous for preprocedural planning. However, the accuracy for stone detection was limited by the presence of aerobilia from previous sphincterotomy or biliary-enteric anastomosis. Ductal stones less than 3 mm in size within a non-dilated system may be missed due to inadequate spatial resolution. This occurred in a patient with pancreatic duct stones. It is hoped that the accuracy of HASTE magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in evaluation of pancreatico-biliary disease would obviate the need for diagnostic invasive cholangiography in selected patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|14719768|Gallbladder polyps, cholesterolosis, adenomyomatosis, and acute acalculous cholecystitis.|Acute acalculous cholecystitis is characterized by acute inflammation of the gallbladder in the absence of stones, usually occurring in elderly and critically ill patients with atherosclerosis, recent surgery or trauma, or hemodynamic instability. Patients may present with only unexplained fever, leukocytosis, and hyperamylasemia without right upper quadrant tenderness. If untreated, rapid progression to gangrene and perforation occurs. Surgical cholecystectomy and cholecystostomy provide the most definitive treatment although recent studies indicate success with percutaneous or endoscopic cholecystostomy. Cholesterolosis and adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder are usually clinically silent and incidental findings at the time of cholecystectomy. Cholesterolosis is characterized by mucosal villous hyperplasia with excessive accumulation of cholesterol esters within epithelial macrophages. Usually clinically silent, the condition rarely is associated with biliary symptoms or idiopathic pancreatitis and cannot reliably be detected by ultrasonography. Adenomyomatosis describes an acquired, hyperplastic lesion of the gallbladder characterized by excessive proliferation of surface epithelium with invaginations into a thickened muscularis propria. Ultrasonography may reveal a thickened gallbladder wall with intramural diverticula. Adenomyomatosis may portend a higher risk of gallbladder malignancy. Most cases of cholesterolosis and adenomyomatosis identified by imaging require no specific treatment. Gallbladder polyps include all mucosal projections into the gallbladder lumen and include cholesterol polyps, adenomyomas, inflammatory polyps, adenomas, and other miscellaneous polyps. Most polyps are nonneoplastic and rarely cause symptoms. Cholecystectomy is advocated for polyps greater than 10 mm in size because of increased risk of adenomatous or carcinomatous features.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|10390589|Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration.|Since the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the management of common bile duct (CBD) stones has undergone significant change. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy is now routinely done in cases where the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis is suspected preoperatively, with clearance of the bile ducts before laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperative discovery of CBD stones by cholangiography represents a challenge to the surgeon, who must make a decision about when to perform laparoscopic CBD exploration, convert to open surgery, or send the patient for ERCP during the postoperative period. Because ERCP has a definite failure rate, laparoscopic CBD exploration can be a treatment option. Among 2500 laparoscopic cholecystectomies done by our group from January 1991 to June 1997, 50 patients (2%) underwent laparoscopic CBD exploration, 13 by the transcystic technique and 37 by choledocotomy, with a conversion rate of 8% and a hospital stay of 4.3 days. One patient died from complicated pancreatitis following ERCP and unsuccessful extraction of a CBD stone. We obtained our goal of a CBD free of stones in 92% of the cases. We conclude that laparoscopic CBD exploration is an effective method for treating choledocolithiasis that allows management of this pathology in one stage, although it requires advanced laparoscopic skills and adequate equipment.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|2336544|The epidemiology of gallstones in a 70-year-old Danish population.|A random sample of 540 men and women aged 70 years who lived in the western part of Copenhagen County was drawn from the National Central Person Register. The response rate was 74.8% among men and 63.7% among women. Each subject had the gallbladder examined by ultrasonography. The prevalence of gallstone disease was 30.2% and 18.8% among women and men, respectively, being significantly higher among women. Prevalence was assessed in relation to different social and clinical variables. In the univariate analyses gallstone disease was significantly associated with familial occurrence of gallstone disease and high body mass index, whereas it was not significantly associated with social status, childbirths, age at menopause, usage of menopausal hormone therapy, abstinence from alcohol, history of smoking, slimming treatments, and physical activity. By means of a multivariate analysis the history of smoking was found to be significantly associated with gallstone disease when body mass index was taken into account. The significant sex difference disappeared when childbirths and age at menopause were included, which means that clinical variables specific for women in the fertile period could explain the sex difference in gallstone prevalence.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

These changes occur either due to extrinsic compression of the bile ducts or due to ischaemic biliary stenosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of CDFI in demonstrating the biliary changes in patients with EHPVO. Three out of 46 patients with EHPVO (7%), who presented clinically with obstructive jaundice, were subjected to a detailed CDFI study of the abdomen, followed by ERCP and splenoportovenography (SPV). One of the patients also underwent a repeat CDFI examination at 8 weeks following a lienorenal shunt. In all 3 cases, CDFI easily distinguished the anechoeic structures seen on ultrasound at the porta hepatis as periportal collaterals, the hepatic artery and dilated bile ducts. It revealed the actual indentation made on the common bile duct (CBD) by the collaterals besides showing the presence of biliary calculi. Gallbladder varices were also well demonstrated in all the cases. ERCP confirmed the presence of portal biliopathy besides showing other changes, such as angulation, displacement and stricture of the CBD. SPV confirmed the presence of EHPVO. One patient who underwent shunt surgery showed persistent dilatation of the CBD with calculi. CDFI is a rapid, non-invasive and widely available modality which can be used to demonstrate the biliary changes in patients with EHPVO with obstructive jaundice. It may thus help screen patients who require a further by ERCP examination for the planning of treatment.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD011549|1570617|Significance of sludge and thickened wall in ultrasound evaluation of the gallbladder.|Ultrasonography is reliable in detecting the presence of cholelithiasis. Isolated findings of a thickened gallbladder wall or intraluminal sludge (echogenic bile), or both, are regarded as less reliable in the diagnosis of primary gallbladder pathologic factors and are often thought to be indicators of some other pathologic or physiologic process.

A total of 226 subjects who were not of Danish origin were omitted. The response rate was 78.8% (3,608/4,581). Each person had his or her gallbladder examined by ultrasonography. The examinations took place between November 1982 and February 1984. The overall prevalence of gallstone disease (cases with stones and cholecystectomized cases) in males aged 30, 40, 50, and 60 years was 1.8%, 1.5%, 6.7%, and 12.9%, respectively. The corresponding prevalence in females was 4.8%, 6.1%, 14.4%, and 22.4%, respectively. Differences according to sex were significant in all age groups. Differences between the 40- and 50-year and 50- and 60-year age groups were significant in both sexes. Among subjects with gallstone disease, the disease was unknown to the proband in the majority of males and in the 30-year-old females, but only in half of the women aged 40, 50, and 60 years.

The pathogenesis of biliary cast is not clearly identified, but proposed etiologic factors include post-transplant bile duct damage, ischemia, biliary infection, or post-operative biliary drainage tube. Although biliary casts are uncommon, most of biliary cast syndrome are reported in the liver transplant or hepatic surgery patients.

CD010339|20955975|Hereditary liver disease: gallstones.|Gallstones are common in Western countries and due to pain and complications pose a substantial burden on health care systems. In general, cholesterol gallstones are distinguished from bilirubin gallstones. Bilirubin gallstones form if the ion product of unconjugated bilirubin and calcium in gallbladder bile exceeds the solubilisation capacities of mixed micelles and vesicles. Cholesterol gallstones develop if the amount of cholesterol in gallbladder bile exceeds the maximum concentration that is soluble at the given concentration of bile salts and phospholipids. In addition, cholesterol gallstone formation requires hypomotility of the gallbladder and a mucin gel as nucleation matrix for monohydrate crystals. The individual risk of gallstone formation is determined by interactions of lithogenic alleles of gallstone susceptibility genes and multiple environmental factors. For asymptomatic gallstones, expectant management is recommended, whereas an episode of gallstone-associated pain substantially increases the risk of complications such as cholecystitis, cholangitis and pancreatitis and therefore necessitates cholecystectomy.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|1359914|Gallstone lithotripsy: in vitro comparison of fragmentation with a tunable-dye laser and an ultrasonic wire.|Large bile duct stones require fragmentation prior to extraction through the papilla or through a percutaneous tract. This can be attempted with dissolution therapy, crushing baskets, or lithotripsy. Lithotripsy can be accomplished safely and effectively with tunable-dye laser energy delivered through a flexible, 1-F optical fiber under endoscopic or fluoroscopic guidance, but laser technology is very costly. A prototype, flexible ball-tipped wire coupled to an ultrasonic generator via a piezoelectric crystal has been developed for sonolysis of atheroma and thrombus in humans. The purpose of this experiment was to compare human gallstone fragmentation in vitro with a tunable-dye laser and this prototype wire to see if the less expensive ultrasound device might provide an alternative to costly laser technology. Gallstones from 17 patients were subjected to lithotripsy in a water bath with each device until completely fragmented or 60 seconds had elapsed. Neither device effectively fragmented cholesterol stones under these conditions. The ultrasonic wire completely fragmented 57% of bilirubinate stones in 60 seconds. The tunable-dye laser completely fragmented 100% of bilirubinate stones in less than 35 seconds (P = .04). Tunable-dye laser lithotripsy appears superior to the ultrasonic device for percutaneous treatment of bile duct stones.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The most commonly used techniques to help eliminate residual stones are: exploration of all or most common ducts; operative cholangiography; intraoperative ultrasonography or choledochoscopy. Exploration of common bile ducts on clinical diagnoses leads to high number of negative explorations and has been abandoned. Operative cholangiography performed with modern technique with the use of fluoroscopy is very accurate with a diagnostic accuracy of well above 95%. Cholangiography can be performed preoperatively with the same diagnostic accuracy and thereby save operative time. Intraoperative ultrasonography has recently been introduced for the diagnosis of residual stones and seems to be superior to cholangiography. It is of limited use however, for intrahepatic stones. Intraoperative choledochoscopy finally is the most superior way of achieving intraoperative diagnosis of common bile duct stones.

Intraoperative choledochoscopy finally is the most superior way of achieving intraoperative diagnosis of common bile duct stones. With the advances of ERC and other non-operative techniques, the consequences of leaving calculi in the bile duct are less severe today than before. Non-operative retrieval by percutaneous, endoscopic means or chemical dissolution are effective ways of dealing with residual stones.|0|Ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosis of common bile duct stones
CD011549|2691237|Diagnostic cholangioscopy--comparison with conventional methods (radiology, ultrasonography).|The goals of surgery for calculous biliary disease are to explore as few normal bile ducts as possible and to remove all calculi. The most commonly used techniques to help eliminate residual stones are: exploration of all or most common ducts; operative cholangiography; intraoperative ultrasonography or choledochoscopy. Exploration of common bile ducts on clinical diagnoses leads to high number of negative explorations and has been abandoned. Operative cholangiography performed with modern technique with the use of fluoroscopy is very accurate with a diagnostic accuracy of well above 95%. Cholangiography can be performed preoperatively with the same diagnostic accuracy and thereby save operative time.

The use of routine intraoperative cholangiography prevented serious bile duct injury in one patient. It also showed 75% of patients suspected pre-operatively of having common duct stones, had passed them by the time of cholecystectomy. Eight of 12 diagnosed duct stones (5 suspected, 7 unsuspected) were removed laparoscopically. A technique is described using inexpensive and readily available equipment that allows the transcystic duct treatment of the majority of common duct stones. The development and use of such techniques to laparoscopically treat duct stones will once more allow surgeons to treat all biliary calculi at the one procedure and reduce unnecessary dependence on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography/sphincterotomy.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|8363482|Left lateral laparoscopic cholecystectomy and its relevance to choledocholithiasis.|One of the current challenges to the laparoscopic biliary surgeon is the management of bile duct stones. While laparoscopic bile duct exploration is in its infancy, pre- and postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with or without endoscopic papillotomy (ERCP/EP) currently plays a significant role. Intra-operative ERCP/EP has advantages over pre- and postoperative ERCP/EP; however it has not gained popularity due, partly, to the difficulties associated with ERCP/EP being performed with the patient in the supine position. This study prospectively assessed, in 10 consecutive patients, the feasibility of performing laparoscopic cholecystectomies in the left lateral position, a position amenable to intra-operative ERCP/EP if necessary. It is concluded that laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the left lateral position can be performed safely, with similar ease and results as in the supine position, increasing the options available to manage choledocholithiasis.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

It was revealed that 61 men had gallstones, 37 had had their gallbladder removed previously, and 55 had a history of gastrectomy. The prevalence of gallstones was 3.5 times higher in the men who had previously undergone gastrectomy (7.7%) than in those who had not (2.2%) (P = 0.03). Moreover, gallstones tended to be more prevalent in those who had undergone Billroth II gastrectomy (12.5%) compared with those who had undergone Billroth I gastrectomy (5.6%); however, the difference was not significant. These results indicate that gastrectomy using either Billroth I or Billroth II reconstruction predisposes to gallstone formation. Nevertheless, it was estimated that prior gastrectomy was responsible for no more than 5% of gallstones in the study population.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|18708406|Variants of DNA repair genes and the risk of biliary tract cancers and stones: a population-based study in China.|Biliary tract cancers, which encompass tumors of the gallbladder, extrahepatic ducts, and ampulla of Vater, are relatively rare tumors with a high fatality rate. Other than a close link with gallstones, the etiology of biliary tract cancers is poorly understood. We conducted a population-based case-control study in Shanghai, China, to examine whether genetic variants in several DNA repair genes are associated with biliary tract cancers or biliary stones. Genomic DNA from 410 patients with biliary tract cancers (236 gallbladder, 127 bile duct, and 47 ampulla of Vater), 891 patients with biliary stones, and 786 healthy subjects randomly selected from the Shanghai population were genotyped for putative functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in four DNA repair genes (MGMT, RAD23B, CCNH, and XRCC3). Of the five single nucleotide polymorphisms examined, only one (MGMT EX5-25C>T, rs12917) was associated with biliary tract cancer. Independent of gallstones, subjects carrying the CT genotype of the MGMT EX5-25C>T marker had a significantly reduced risk of gallbladder cancer [odds ratio (OR), 0.63; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.41-0.97; P = 0.02] and nonsignificant reduced risks of bile duct (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.35-1.06) and ampulla of Vater (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.39-1.87) cancers. However, this marker was not associated with biliary stones, and the other markers examined were not significantly associated with either biliary tract cancers or stones. Findings from this population-based study in Shanghai suggest that MGMT gene variants may alter susceptibility to biliary tract cancer, particularly gallbladder cancer. Confirmation in future studies, however, is required.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

With an overall mortality rate of 0.18 percent and a reoperation rate of 1.3 percent, conventional cholecystectomy proved to be a safe method. Mortality proved to be age dependent, with a zero mortality rate for patients less than 60 years of age. Choledochotomy had a 13-fold greater mortality rate than simple cholecystectomy (0.92 versus 0.07 percent). For acute cholecystitis, we observed an unusual zero mortality rate, whereas the mortality rate in chronic cholecystitis was 0.2 percent. All three patients who died had an accompanying cirrhosis of the liver.

CD010339|8190955|Imaging of gallbladder carcinoma.|Although carcinoma of the gallbladder has a low overall prevalence, it is the most common malignant tumor of the biliary tract. Retrospectively, 59 cases of histologically proved gallbladder carcinoma were reviewed. The series consisted of 42 women and 17 men, ranging in age from 35 to 86 years. Clinical manifestations of gallbladder carcinoma include right upper quadrant pain, anorexia, weight loss, and jaundice. Radiologic findings included focal or diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall (49%), a mass in the gallbladder fossa (37%), and an intraluminal mass (14%). Associated findings were cholelithiasis (64%), biliary duct dilatation (38%), invasion of the adjacent structures (67%), distant metastases other than those of the liver (3%), and porcelain gallbladder (4%). The histologic diagnoses were adenocarcinoma (90%) and squamous cell carcinoma (10%). Differential diagnoses include all conditions in which the gallbladder wall appears thickened. A general awareness of the radiologic features of gallbladder carcinoma enhances preoperative diagnoses.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|10421013|Prevalence of gallstones in a Brazilian population.|The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of gallstones in the population of Curitiba, Brazil. A total of 1000 persons was randomly recruited among individuals who were visiting two shopping centers of the city in order to represent the Brazilian population in relation to age and sex. The selected people underwent ultrasonographic examination of the upper abdomen immediately after a medical interview. Of the 1000 persons evaluated, 93 (9.3%) had gallstones (64 persons) or had been subjected to cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis. The gallstone prevalence increased from 2.4% in persons of 20-29 years of age to 27.5% in persons of more than 70 years (chi2 = 37.29; P <0.001). The prevalence was 2.4 greater in females (12.9%) than in males (5.4%) (chi2 = 16.34; P <0.001). The prevalence increased with the number of pregnancies from 4% in nulliparous women, to 34.6% in persons with a history of six or more pregnancies (chi2 = 200.1; P <0,001). The prevalence also increased according to the body weight (chi2 = 30.08; P <0.001). There was no difference in the prevalence between individuals with diabetes mellitus and controls.

The minimum dose (mg kg-1 day-1) required to desaturate bile consistently was 10.1 for UDCA and 14.3 for CDCA. In patients completing six months' treatment, 23 of 35 (66%) taking a mean of 7.7 (+/- SEM 0.5) mg UDCA and 34 of 42 (81%) taking 14.7 +/- 0.2 mg CDCA showed partial or complete dissolution of gallstones. The mean dose in the UDCA-treated patients, however, was artefactually lowered by previous dose-response studies: in those who had not taken multiple doses, the mean UDCA intake in the 'responders' at six months was 9.1 +/- 0.3 mg kg-1 day-1. At six months, more UDCA (five of 35 or 14.3%) than CDCA (four of 42 or 9.5%)-treated patients showed complete dissolution of gallstones, but, by one year, the situation was reversed, 20 of 41 (49%) CDCA-treated and eight of 30 (27%) UDCA-treated patients showing complete dissolution of gallstones.

CD010339|10903685|MR cholangiopancreatography of bile and pancreatic duct abnormalities with emphasis on the single-shot fast spin-echo technique.|Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is used for noninvasive work-up of patients with pancreaticobiliary disease. MRCP is comparable with invasive endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for diagnosis of extrahepatic bile duct abnormalities. In patients with choledocholithiasis, calculi appear as dark filling defects within the high-signal-intensity fluid at MRCP. Benign strictures due to sclerosing cholangitis are multifocal and alternate with slight dilatation or normal-caliber bile ducts, producing a beaded appearance. Dilatation of both the pancreatic and bile ducts at MRCP is highly suggestive of a pancreatic head malignancy. Side-branch ectasia is the most prominent and specific feature of chronic pancreatitis. MRCP is more sensitive than ERCP in detection of pancreatic pseudocysts because less than 50% of pseudocysts fill with contrast material. Because the mucin secreted by biliary cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas causes filling defects and partial obstruction of contrast material at ERCP, MRCP is potentially more accurate in demonstrating the extent of these tumors. In patients with biliary-enteric anastomoses, MRCP is the imaging modality of choice for the work-up of suspected pancreaticobiliary disease. A potential use of MRCP is the demonstration of aberrant bile duct anatomy before cholecystectomy. MRCP is also accurate in detection of pancreas divisum.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Of 109 patients, 78 underwent sphincteroplasty, whereas 31 had a transduodenal sphincterotomy. Surgical indications included: group 1, 53 patients with common duct stones; group 2, 28 patients with dyskinesia or stenosis of the sphincter of Oddi (without choledocholithiasis or recurrent pancreatitis); and group 3, 28 patients with recurrent pancreatitis. Three elderly group 1 patients who presented with cholangitis died after surgery (a hospital mortality of 2.7%). Seventy-nine of the 103 patients (77%) in whom follow-up was obtained achieved an excellent or good result. Results were almost identical with sphincteroplasty and sphincterotomy. Abnormal preoperative liver function tests were the only predictors of a good postoperative outcome (p less than 0.05). Group 3 patients (good results in 63%) had significantly poorer (p less than 0.05) outcome than group 1 and 2 patients. Results were worst in group 3 patients who had undergone previous abdominal or pelvic surgery (p less than 0.025) and in group 2 patients who were narcotic users (p less than 0.025). The authors conclude that transduodenal sphincteroplasty or sphincterotomy can be performed relatively safely, but caution that careful selection of patients is important when the indication for surgery is either ampullary stenosis or recurrent pancreatitis.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

MRVE views were generated with Navigator software. Segmentation of the acquired data sets was performed with a thresholding technique. Navigation sequences were simulated through the entire biliary tract. MRVE was obtained in 27 (63%) of the 43 normal patients. Endoscopic views were generated in all 77 patients with partial or complete obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary tree. Among these, three groups of patterns were identified: 36 (47%) endoluminal masses (polyp-like masses), 17 (22%) luminal stenoses, 24 (31%) luminal occlusion. In 29 cases, hole artifacts through the internal wall were observed and interpreted as mistakes of segmentation. MRVE proved to show the internal anatomy of the biliary tract and endoluminal changes due to pathological condition.

An operative technique that involves commencing the laparoscopic dissection on the body of the gallbladder and dissecting toward the cystic duct has been developed that minimizes the risk of major duct injury. The aim of this study was to assess prospectively the safety of this dissection technique. A group of 410 patients underwent LC for symptomatic cholelithiasis from January 1991 to December 1992. There was a single common hepatic duct injury: a small (1 mm) side hole in a patient with acute cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis. It was managed at open operation with exploration of the common bile duct and insertion of a T-tube. There were no partial or complete common bile duct transections in this series.

Recent epidemiological studies].|Until a few years ago, our knowledge about the epidemiology of gall-stones was limited on account of the absence of diagnostic methods for investigation of extensive populations. Development of ultrasound scanning has had the result that, within the past six or seven years, a number of screening investigations for gall-stones in populations selected at random have been undertaken. These investigations reveal that the great majority of cases of gall-stones are undiagnosed. The prevalence increases with age and is higher in women than in men. The latter observation is due to factors which are specific for women, mainly pregnancies but possibly also employment of hormones and the duration of the fertile period. Familial accumulation of gall-stone disease is also observed. Obesity, smoking and abstinence from alcohol appear also to be related to gall-stones while the significance of diet is still poorly elucidated. Gall-stones appear to be associated with both lipid and glucose metabolism.

Obesity, smoking and abstinence from alcohol appear also to be related to gall-stones while the significance of diet is still poorly elucidated. Gall-stones appear to be associated with both lipid and glucose metabolism. During the coming years, a series of incidence investigations may be anticipated and these will further increase our knowledge about risk factors for gall-stones.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones

In 23 of 36 patients who had common hepatic ducts larger than 4 mm, the cause of biliary obstruction was found at surgery. In the remaining 13 patients, no evidence of obstruction was found on subsequent radiographic studies, and none of these patients underwent surgery. Eight patients had common bile ducts that were considered to be dilated (> 1cm) on subsequent intravenous cholangiography. In 20 patients whose common hepatic ducts measured 4 mm or less, 17 had no evidence of dilatation on subsequent radiographic studies, but three had choledocholithiasis.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Negative operative cholangiograms obviated the necessity for exploration in a substantial number of cases. Cholecystectomy without operative cholangiography was performed in 438 patients. From the average experience of those employing routine cholangiography (6 percent incidence of unsuspected stones), we presumably missed common duct stones in about 26 patients, but those stones either passed spontaneously or caused no problems. A single patient requiring reoperation for a retained stone was not a candidate for cholangiography at the original operation. No common duct injuries occurred in the series.

CD010339|3429836|Efficacy of ceruletide controlled saline infusion for retained ductal stones after cholecystectomy and exploration of the common bile duct.|The synthetic peptide ceruletide induces maximal relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi. In a preliminary communication, ceruletide controlled saline infusion of the common bile duct (CBD) was found to be effective in promoting the passage of retained ductal calculi after cholecystectomy and exploration of the common bile duct. This paper reports on the further experience with this simple treatment which was administered to 27 patients with retained ductal calculi in 16 different hospitals within the U.K. The success of the procedure was documented by repeat T-tube cholangiography. Passage of stones into the duodenum was documented in 13 patients (48%) with complete clearance in 9 (33%) following one saline infusion/ceruletide treatment. The radiological stone size ranged from 3 to 15 mm. Within this range, there was no correlation between a successful outcome and size of retained stones. The duration of the saline T-tube infusion during ceruletide treatment averaged 54.7/min (SD 14.3). There was no correlation between flow rate of saline through the T-tube and a successful outcome. A significant inverse correlation was observed between the CBD pressure during ceruletide controlled saline T-tube infusion and successful stone passage (chi 2 = 9.9, P less than 0.01). Ampullary impaction by a stone was encountered in one patient. These results are encouraging and indicate that pharmacological dilatation of the sphincter of Oddi together with saline infusion is effective in the management of retained stones after exploration of the common bile duct. This treatment, which does not require any special expertise, should be tried in the first instance before more invasive procedures are used.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Patients undergoing biliary surgery by one surgical team in Southampton were operated upon in one of three hospitals. The choledochoscope was available for use at only one hospital, but the other two were otherwise fully equipped, and no selection of patients was made for any particular hospital. Over a period of 7 years, 707 patients underwent elective or emergency cholecystectomy. Routine choledochography was performed and stones were found or suspected in the bile ducts in 103 (14.6 per cent). The choledochoscope was used in 54 of the bile duct explorations and in 10 patients residual calculi following routine exploration were identified by the instrument. Postoperative T-tube choledochography was performed in 35 patients following choledochoscopy, 31 with choledocholithiasis at operation, and no unsuspected retained stones were demonstrated. In the 49 patients undergoing duct exploration by the same team without the choledochoscope, 32 were found to have choledocholithiasis. Thirty-six postoperative choledochograms were performed and six patients were found to have retained stones. There were no additional complications attributed to the use of the instrument. We conclude that the use of the choledochoscope should reduce the incidence of retained bile duct stones.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to evaluate the impact of tamoxifen on gallstone formation in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. A total of 3165 patients who were treated for invasive breast cancer between 1990 and 1997 were reviewed. The data were collected from four university hospitals in a population-based registry. Among these patients, 2462 were excluded from the study owing to improper follow-up and other reasons. Premenopausal patients were also excluded. Of the 703 patients included in the study, 457 had received adjuvant therapy including tamoxifen, and the other 246 had not. Gallstone formation was assessed by annual abdominal ultrasonography. The mean follow-up period was 4.6 years (range 1-7 years). There were no significant differences between the groups of breast cancer patients treated with or without tamoxifen regarding the age of the patients at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, the age at menopause, the duration between the onset of menopause and the time the breast cancer was diagnosed, the presence of diabetes, and the body mass index. At the end of 5 years the incidence of gallstone formation in tamoxifen-treated patients was 37.4%, whereas it was 2.0% in patients who did not receive tamoxifen ( p < 0.0001). The incidences of gallstones being detected in 171 tamoxifen-treated patients were 0.4%, 3.7%, 24.4%, 33.1%, and 37.4% cumulatively during the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth years, respectively. Hence adjuvant tamoxifen therapy leads to gallstone formation in postmenopausal breast cancer patients and is most apparent after 3 years of treatment.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|1558499|Intraoperative cholangiography revisited.|The charts of 1351 patients undergoing cholecystectomy at our institutions from 1985 through 1989 were reviewed retrospectively to evaluate the indications for and the success of intraoperative cholangiography. A total of 800 patients underwent intraoperative cholangiography. They were divided into two groups based on the absence (CR-) or presence (CR+) of clinical and/or operative criteria suggestive of the existence of common bile duct stones. Intraoperative cholangiography in CR- patients was of limited benefit, being negative (normal) in 95.7%, true-positive (abnormal) in 3.3%, and false-positive in 1%. False-positive intraoperative cholangiography resulted in unnecessary common bile duct explorations. Intraoperative cholangiography in CR+ patients proved useful, avoiding unnecessary common bile duct exploration in 55%. In those select CR+ patients with palpable common bile duct stones or cholangitis, little additional information was gained by the intraoperative cholangiography. We conclude that routine screening intraoperative cholangiography in CR- patients be reconsidered, as should the use of intraoperative cholangiography in CR+ patients with a palpable common bile duct stone or cholangitis. Intraoperative cholangiography in the remainder of CR+ patients proved beneficial and should be continued.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|3521357|Iatrogenic hemobilia.|Biliary tract hemorrhage is increasingly reported as a complication of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on the liver and the bile ducts. Major hemobilia with profuse, even life-threatening, hemorrhage which necessitates emergency surgical intervention is uncommon. Minor hemobilia with melena or clot production in the ducts, although more common, may cause diagnostic difficulties. Diagnosis is obtained either endoscopically to demonstrate bleeding through the papilla of Vater, or through hepatic arteriography, which has the advantage of indicating the location of the lesion. Operative treatment with resection of the lesion or ligature of the hepatic artery or a branch has been replaced by embolization of the affected artery. Diagnostic procedures that may cause hemobilia include percutaneous needle biopsy and transhepatic cholangiography. The risk of hemorrhage increases if a catheter is left in place for drainage. Difficult extractions of common duct stones may cause hemorrhage due to lesions of the vulnerable duct mucosa. Finally, spontaneous hemobilia may, like hematuria or epistaxis, be caused by an overdose of anticoagulants.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|3948800|Investigation of the sphincter of Oddi before, immediately after and six weeks after endoscopic papillotomy.|"The sphincter of Oddi was investigated before, immediately after and 6 weeks after endoscopic sphincterotomy by endoscopic inspection, ERCP manometry, and by X-ray following retrograde cholangiography in 14 patients presenting with bile duct stones. The sphincter motility was normal before sphincterotomy. Following electrocautery no sphincter motility was noted, the sphincter baseline pressure showed considerable interindividual changes, and the length of the residual sphincter seemed to be only slightly reduced from 14.1 mm (before) to 10.9 mm. Despite this fact, bile duct concrements of more than 10 mm in diameter could be extracted without difficulty in all patients, confirming the adequacy of the sphincterotomy. Six weeks after sphincterotomy the sphincter length was 1.9 mm (0 to 7 mm) and in 6 patients the sphincter was completely incompetent, as demonstrated by the bile duct pressure (0 mmHg) and aerocholia, in the remaining 8 patients a small residual sphincter was able to maintain sphincter patency. We conclude that ERCP manometry cannot serve to confirm completeness of sphincterotomy immediately after electrocautery. But it would be possible to perform ""semisphincterotomy"" by assessing the sphincter length before cutting. Since sphincterotomy causes sphincter incompetence only in some patients, ERCP manometry would be a reliable aid for classifying the patients for follow-up studies."|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Computerized tomography was performed in 46 patients. Ultrasonography has a sensitivity of 92.6% while that of computerized tomography was 87.2% for the identification of dilated biliary ducts. Computerized tomography demonstrated the level of obstruction with a sensitivity of 89.1%, being most useful at the suprapancreatic and ampullary levels, while ultrasound examination had a sensitivity of 80%. The accuracy of ultrasonography was higher than the one obtained in computerized tomography in cholangiocarcinoma (sensitivity: 77%) and gallbladder carcinoma (sensitivity: 100%).

Cholelithiasis was present in 6 (5.6%). We did not observe any association between the quantity of ethanol consumed and/or the time of consumption and the presence of cholelithiasis. There was no significant difference between the frequency of cholelithiasis in these patients and that found in autopsies carried out on 716 male patients (6%) at the Hospital de Clínicas, Universidade Federal de Uberlândia, during the period 1982 to 1993. Thus, we conclude that in the cases we examined, alcoholism did not represent a risk factor for biliary lithogenesis.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|2013195|The value of ultrasound in predicting non-visualization of the gall-bladder on OCG: implications for imaging strategies in patient selection for non-surgical therapy of gallstones.|Gall-bladder visualization on oral cholecystography (OCG) is required for most non-surgical therapies of gallstones. In this study we attempted to establish sonographic criteria which will predict non-visualization of the gall-bladder on OCG. For this purpose we compared the results of ultrasound (US) and OCG in 171 patients with gallstones being assessed for non-surgical therapy. Sonographic criteria for non-visualization were a contracted gall-bladder and stone impaction in the gall-bladder neck or cystic duct. In detecting findings which predict non-visualization on OCG, US had a sensitivity of 78.3% and a specificity of 97.6%. The predictive values were: positive findings 92.3% and negative findings 92.4%. The overall accuracy was 92.4%. We conclude that US can be used as a first step in selecting patients for non-surgical therapy and if US indicates a contracted gall-bladder, 11% of the patients can be excluded from further diagnostic imaging.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|2179026|Increased volume and decreased emptying of the gallbladder in large (morbidly obese, tall normal, and muscular normal) people.|Impaired gallbladder emptying has been suggested as a possible factor in the pathogenesis of gallstones. Obese people have an increased incidence of gallstones, but there is no evidence of this in nonobese large people. This study was undertaken to determine if abnormal gallbladder motility is present in obese people. Fasting gallbladder volumes were determined using real-time ultrasound in 18 morbidly obese subjects whose weights were in a steady state [45 kg (100 lb) over ideal weight or twice expected weight for age and height; 9 males, 9 females], 18 age- and sex-matched volunteers of average size, and 18 nonobese large normal males (9 tall, 9 muscular). Gallbladder emptying studies with 99mtechnetium-diisopropyliminodiacetic acid were performed using 200 ml of 10% cream as a stimulus. The small-volume liquid fatty meal contained 113indium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid to control for differences in gastric emptying in obesity. The gallbladder emptying rate in large people, both obese and nonobese, was less than that in normals of average size (p = 0.05). Fasting gallbladder volumes in large people were: obese, 41 ml (37-66 ml) (median; 95% confidence limits); nonobese large normal, 40 ml (27-43 ml). These values were greater than in normals of average size [17 ml (14-21 ml) (p = 0.03)]. Postprandial gallbladder volumes were also greater in large people: obese, 15 ml (8-23 ml); nonobese large normal, 20 ml (13-23 ml) compared with 2 ml (1-5 ml) in normals of average size (p less than 0.05). There were no differences between obese and nonobese large people. There were no differences in gastric emptying rates or in cholecystokinin, gastrin, motilin, and secretin release between obese and normal subjects. Gallbladder volume is crudely proportional to body size. Although fasting and postprandial volumes are greater in obesity, this is also present in nonobese, relatively size-matched controls. These data do not support a role for impaired gallbladder emptying in gallstone formation in obese patients whose weights are in a steady state.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

This aroused some doubts and the scan was repeated after some minutes: an absolutely normal infundibulum was visualized. The shadowing was therefore an artifact probably due to a partial volume effect of the air contained in the distended duodenum, in contact with the gallbladder.

CD010339|1805397|Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy and endoscopy: combined therapy for problematic bile duct stones.|Endoscopic treatment of bile duct stones is currently successful in 86% of patients. We prospectively studied the efficacy and complication rate of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) of problematic bile duct stones combined with endoscopy. When stone removal was not possible, patients were subjected to ESWL. Fragmented stones were removed endoscopically. During 1 year, 220 patients presenting with choledocholithiasis were diagnosed and 188 were successfully treated endoscopically. In all, 3 subjects received alternative treatment and the remaining 29 (13%) constituted our study group; 19 (65%) were women and the mean age was 76.7 years. Overall, 22 (76%) were high-risk patients; 23 (79%) were jaundiced and 9 (31%) had cholangitis at admission. The most frequent indication for ESWL was stone size. Stone fragmentation was achieved in 80% of cases. Complications were mild and were managed conservatively. No patient died. Complete stone clearance was possible in 23 (80%) cases. The association of ESWL and endoscopy enhanced the success rate of endoscopic stone clearance from 86% to 96%.

We prospectively studied the efficacy and complication rate of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) of problematic bile duct stones combined with endoscopy. When stone removal was not possible, patients were subjected to ESWL. Fragmented stones were removed endoscopically. During 1 year, 220 patients presenting with choledocholithiasis were diagnosed and 188 were successfully treated endoscopically. In all, 3 subjects received alternative treatment and the remaining 29 (13%) constituted our study group; 19 (65%) were women and the mean age was 76.7 years. Overall, 22 (76%) were high-risk patients; 23 (79%) were jaundiced and 9 (31%) had cholangitis at admission. The most frequent indication for ESWL was stone size. Stone fragmentation was achieved in 80% of cases. Complications were mild and were managed conservatively. No patient died. Complete stone clearance was possible in 23 (80%) cases. The association of ESWL and endoscopy enhanced the success rate of endoscopic stone clearance from 86% to 96%.

CD010339|1805396|Choledochoscopy during biliary surgery for reducing the risk of overlooked stones.|Although cholangiography is routinely performed during biliary surgery to ensure the removal of all stones, it is not always successful. Some investigators have claimed that intraoperative choledochoscopy is more effective in detecting all stones, although reports on the efficacy of this method have been contradictory. Furthermore, no study has systematically examined either of these procedures in terms of the actual incidence of overlooked stones. Thus, to evaluate the merits of intraoperative cholangiography as opposed to choledochoscopy, we studied the incidence of overlooked bile duct stones after surgery. We investigated 126 patients who had undergone surgery during which choledocholithotomy was performed within the past 10 years; 117 of these cases involved common bile duct stones and 22, intrahepatic stones. After the exclusion of 13 subjects whose stones were deliberately left for postoperative treatment due to severe complications, 126 patients were finally analyzed. Overlooked stones were found postoperatively in 13 (10%) of these 126 subjects, including 11 (14%) of 63 patients who had been inspected by intraoperative cholangiography alone and 2 (3%) of 63 who had undergone both choledochoscopy and cholangiography during surgery. Therefore, the incidence of overlooked stones proved to be significantly lower in those who had undergone choledochoscopy combined with cholangiography (P less than 0.01). Our results suggest the value of combining choledochoscopy with cholangiography during surgery for reducing the risk of overlooked bile duct stones.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The procedure was successful in 105 patients (85.3%) and it accurately detected abnormality of the pancreatico-biliary system in 71 patients (67.6%). ERCP results were abnormal in 82.6% of patients with biliary symptoms, with or without jaundice, compared with 34.7% of patients with non-biliary symptoms (P less than 0.001). Though ERCP showed abnormality in all patients with biliary symptoms and jaundice, as many as 70.4% of patients without jaundice had abnormal ERCP. The commonest abnormality was retained/recurrent stones (37/105 patients). Patients with biliary strictures presented significantly more often with jaundice compared with patients with biliary stones (74.3% vs 22.3%). In 19 of the 37 patients with retained biliary stones endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed and it was successful in 16 patients (84.2%).

Bile leaks generally occur within the first 3 months and are frequently related to T-tube removal. The recent trend to avoid of T-tubes has probably resulted in a reduced incidence of such bile leaks. The other major biliary complications in liver transplant recipients include biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, biliary casts and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Biliary strictures can be classified into anastomotic and non-anastomotic strictures. Anastomotic strictures are generally related to technical complications of choledochocholedochostomy, while non-anastomotic strictures are frequently related to hepatic artery thrombosis. The overwhelming majority of biliary complications choledochocholedochostomy can be managed by endoscopic means, ranging from use of plastic stents, balloon dilation or endoscopic sphincteromoty. Surgical revision may be required in rare instances such as recurrent biliary casts or large caliber leaks associated with anastomotic strictures. The purpose of this review is to review the incidence, risk factors for and pathogenesis of biliary complications after liver transplantation.

However, gallstone recurrence can be shown in only 40-60% of these patients. Therefore, other causes, such as sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD), may be suspected. Twenty-two consecutive patients with recurrent biliary pain after successful gallstone lithotripsy without evidence of gallstone recurrence at ultrasonography were enrolled. Liver tests were elevated in 13 patients and ERC showed a dilated bile duct in nine. All 22 patients underwent sphincter of Oddi (SO) manometry, bile sample analysis for microlithiasis, endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES), and bile duct exploration with a Dormia basket. Thereafter, the patients were clinically followed at bimonthly intervals. SO manometry revealed SOD in 15/22 patients. This was more often the case in patients with initially larger (>2 cm) or multiple stones than after lithotripsy for solitary small stones (P < 0.01). Microlithiasis was detected in one patient, another patient had small biliary calculi at bile duct exploration (both without SOD). After ES, 14/15 patients with biliary SOD but none of the five without SOD improved (median follow-up: two years; P < 0.01). The one patient with CBD stones became symptom-free after ES, while the patient with microlithiasis improved after additional cholecystectomy only. Overall, ES proved to be the adequate therapy in 15/22 patients (68%, median follow-up: 22 months). After gallstone lithotripsy, SOD is found in about two thirds of patients with recurrent symptoms but without gallstone recurrence. In this group CBD stones or microlithiasis are rare. Therefore, SOD has to be suspected in this situation and ES gives favorable results, even when performed on a clinical basis only (without SO manometry).|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

A statistical study of the county of Stockholm, Sweden, 1969-1982.|From 1969 to 1982 there has been a continuous decrease in the cholecystectomy rate in the county of Stockholm, Sweden, from 265 per 100.000 population to 105. The change is greatest among young females. During the same period there has been a two-fold increase in gallbladder cancer. Although the total number of cases with common bile duct stones have decreased, they have increased in relation to the number of cholecystectomies. A similar trend is true for cases with and operations for acute cholecystitis. From 1970 to 1982 there has been a fairly constant number of cholecystographies and ultra sound scans of the biliary tract indicating that the diagnostic efforts have been unchanged, at least quantitatively. However, cases with positive diagnosis have decreased especially among young females. It is concluded that the decreased cholecystectomy rate in the county of Stockholm can be explained by a simultaneous decrease of the prevalence of gallstones, at least among the young, and a decrease of operations among those who have gallstones.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|2316941|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in a general surgery practice.|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is performed for the diagnosis and therapy of benign and malignant biliary and pancreatic disease. There are few reports in the literature regarding the incorporation of this procedure into a general surgery practice. One hundred seven consecutive ERCPs performed by the same surgeon over a two-year period were reviewed. The most frequent indications for ERCP were jaundice, suspected common bile duct stones, and a history of pancreatitis. Successful cannulation of the ampulla of Vater was achieved in 97 per cent of the cases with the desired duct being adequately visualized in 90 per cent of the cases. Sphincterotomy was performed in 42 per cent of the procedures and common bile duct stones were removed with a balloon or basket catheter. The overall complication rate was seven per cent with no mortality. ERCP accounted for 20 per cent of all endoscopies and 12 per cent of all procedures performed by the surgeon. Twelve per cent of these patients were subsequently operated upon by the surgeon while another 16 per cent requiring surgery were returned to the referring physician. This study supports the feasibility of the incorporation of ERCP into a general surgery practice.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD009323|8509045|Diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy biliary complications.|Radiological imaging and therapeutic interventions were performed in eight patients with biliary complications following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The diagnostic approach and the outcome of the therapeutic procedures were evaluated. Complications observed were bile leakage from the cystic duct stump (n = 2); erroneous identification of the cystic duct leading to common hepatic duct transection (n = 1) and hepatic duct ligation (n = 2); liver abscess (n = 1); and retained common duct stones (n = 2). Diagnostic ultrasonography is capable of detecting the presence of abnormal fluid collection and the diameter of the common duct with or without the presence of a stone, although bile leaks and retained common duct stones can only be demonstrated by either endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. Once a bile leak had been confirmed, therapeutic endoscopic biliary stenting was successfully applied in one patient while the other received percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. Definitive diagnosis of retained common duct stone was established by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and immediate endoscopic sphincterotomy with stone extraction was performed. Follow-up radiological imaging was done to determine the effectiveness of the therapeutic procedures applied in each patient. All our patients improved clinically, and further surgical intervention was not needed.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

In all 10 patients the gallbladders visualized on oral cholecystography and no stones were identified by cholecystography or ultrasonography but biliary drainage revealed aggregates of bile pigment granules. In eight of the 10 patients, cholecystectomy was eventually performed, recommended on the basis of the abnormal findings on biliary drainage. None of the eight patients who underwent cholecystectomy and followed for up to two years have had further bouts of pancreatitis.

CD010339|2669662|Gallstone formation during weight-reduction dieting.|We investigated the development of gallstones over an 8-week period from the onset of dieting in 51 obese men and women and 26 nondieting control subjects. Gallbladder examinations were performed by abdominal real-time ultrasonography for the detection of gallstones. Initial sonography was performed prior to dieting and only those subjects in whom initial sonograms showed no gallstones or sludge were included in the study. Repeated sonography was performed at 4-week intervals for 8 weeks while they remained on a 2100-kJ/d diet. Initial weight of subjects prior to dieting averaged 105.9 +/- 3.8 kg (162% of ideal body weight) and decreased to 89.4 +/- 3.2 kg (137.3% of ideal body weight) after 8 weeks of dieting. Sonography performed after 4 weeks of dieting revealed new-onset gallbladder sludge in 1 subject and gallstones in 4 subjects. After 8 weeks of dieting sludge was detected in 3 subjects and gallstones in 13 (25.5%). In contrast, none of the nondieting subjects developed any detectable gallbladder abnormalities. During the dieting period, 1 of 51 subjects developed symptoms of biliary colic, necessitating cholecystectomy. On cessation of dieting with reinstitution of normal feeding, 2 additional subjects with stones developed symptoms severe enough to require cholecystectomy. In all 3 cases, cholesterol gallstones were recovered at the time of surgery. Eleven of the 13 patients with gallstones were followed up for 6 months after discontinuation of the diet. Besides the 3 undergoing cholecystectomy, 4 subjects had gallstones on follow-up ultrasound examination, while sonographically detectable gallstones had disappeared in 4 subjects. We conclude that this form of weight-reduction dieting predisposes to the development of gallstones and that gallstone formation is a risk of this type of prolonged calorie restriction. Dissolution or evacuation of gallstones may occur with resumption of a normal diet.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones
CD011548|2669662|Gallstone formation during weight-reduction dieting.|We investigated the development of gallstones over an 8-week period from the onset of dieting in 51 obese men and women and 26 nondieting control subjects. Gallbladder examinations were performed by abdominal real-time ultrasonography for the detection of gallstones. Initial sonography was performed prior to dieting and only those subjects in whom initial sonograms showed no gallstones or sludge were included in the study. Repeated sonography was performed at 4-week intervals for 8 weeks while they remained on a 2100-kJ/d diet. Initial weight of subjects prior to dieting averaged 105.9 +/- 3.8 kg (162% of ideal body weight) and decreased to 89.4 +/- 3.2 kg (137.3% of ideal body weight) after 8 weeks of dieting. Sonography performed after 4 weeks of dieting revealed new-onset gallbladder sludge in 1 subject and gallstones in 4 subjects. After 8 weeks of dieting sludge was detected in 3 subjects and gallstones in 13 (25.5%). In contrast, none of the nondieting subjects developed any detectable gallbladder abnormalities. During the dieting period, 1 of 51 subjects developed symptoms of biliary colic, necessitating cholecystectomy. On cessation of dieting with reinstitution of normal feeding, 2 additional subjects with stones developed symptoms severe enough to require cholecystectomy. In all 3 cases, cholesterol gallstones were recovered at the time of surgery. Eleven of the 13 patients with gallstones were followed up for 6 months after discontinuation of the diet. Besides the 3 undergoing cholecystectomy, 4 subjects had gallstones on follow-up ultrasound examination, while sonographically detectable gallstones had disappeared in 4 subjects. We conclude that this form of weight-reduction dieting predisposes to the development of gallstones and that gallstone formation is a risk of this type of prolonged calorie restriction.

CD010339|2919583|Pancreatic pseudocysts: clinical and endoscopic experience.|Records of 51 patients with proven pancreatic pseudocyst (PC) were retrospectively reviewed to assess clinical and endoscopic variables. Thirty-nine had surgery after preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), six patients had ERCP only, and six patients had surgery without prior ERCP. Forty-two pancreatograms were obtained, and all were abnormal. PC communication with the pancreatic duct was present in 29 and ductal obstruction downstream from the PC was shown in 11 studies. Thirty-five cholangiograms were obtained and 19 were abnormal, including ductal narrowing in 16 and biliary calculi in three. PC contents were cultured intraoperatively in 29 patients, and 17 were positive. PC infection was highly correlated with the incidence of recurrent hospitalizations and with PC recurrence. PC infection did not occur significantly more often in patients with communicating PC or in those with preoperative ERCP. Factors that did not influence outcome included PC size, multiplicity, anatomic location, and PC communication with the pancreatic duct. Results from both ERCP and culture of PC contents add significantly to our knowledge of PC disease.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Examined were 217 cholelithiasis patients from the flying personnel including 50 fighter, 67 transport, 31 long haul and 69 helicopter pilots. All the pilots passed USI in real time, survey and excretory urography, radio-isotope renography and X-ray computerized tomography on indication. The paper review the present-day aspects of radiation diagnostics of cholelithiasis in flying personnel. Semiotic signs of concrement fragmentation during treatment with the method of remote shock-wave lithotripsy were specified.

Of the 115 UHWI patients, the case notes of 96 were available for analysis and this group formed the basis of this review. ERCP had successful cannulation in 95% of patients. There were 70 females and 26 males with a female to male ratio of 2.7:1. Age ranged from 13 to 85 years (mean +/- SD, 43 +/- 17), males being an average six years older than females. The most common indication for ERCP was a patient with cholelithiasis and abnormal liver function tests scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This made up 33% of patients and in this subgroup, sickle cell disease accounted for 50% of cases. Patients with common bile duct stones preoperatively and post-cholecystectomy accounted for 13% and 17% respectively while gallstones pancreatitis accounted for 13% of cases, including three patients with severe pancreatitis.

CD009185|6400077|[Acute cholecystitis].|Acute cholecystitis is a non-rare disease, the incidence of which was increasing in the last years parallel to biliary lithiasis, which in 90% of cases is the first cause of such pathology. From the anatomopathological standpoint, we distinguish three types of acute cholecystitis: catarrhal, suppurative and gangrenous. The most frequently remarked symptom is ache at right hypochondrium. Only in 30% of cases cholecyst can be palpated, in form of ovoid mass; typical is the positiveness of Murphy's manoeuvre; constant is fever, but not subicterus. The introduction of new methods of ascertainment, exempt from any risks, simple to be performed and remarkably careful, made the diagnostics of acute cholecystites easier: parietal cholecystotomography, hepato-biliary scintigraphy, echotomography (first approach investigation), computerized axial tomography and laparoscopy almost always succeed in dispelling doubts. By using more than one of these investigations, a diagnostic accuracy, touching on 100%, can be reached. The differential diagnosis should be placed with: peptic ulcer, acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis, gonococcus perihepatitis, virus hepatitis, acute pyelonephritis, right basal pneumonia. The complications an acute cholecystitis can occur are: perforation (localized, in free peritoneum or in a hollow organ), choleperitonaeum, necrosis of hepatic parenchyma, acute pancreatitis. Due to the possible arising of such complications, the mortality unfortunately is not indifferent (5%), especially in patients already weakened by other chronic diseases. Still discussed is the question as to when performing operation. In fact, there are three trends: intervention in immediate emergency, in postponed emergency, or in remote time (preceded by a medical treatment). The Authors prefer the intervention in postponed emergency, as, in their experience, they remarked the poor effectiveness of the delay medical treatment, also involving a greater difficulty in the technical execution of the intervention and a longer stay in hospital. From 1973 up to 1983, 241 cases of acute cholecystitis (158 women and 83 men) were hospitalized at the First Aid Surgical Centre of the Catania University. Eight patients refused the surgical intervention. The remaining 233 underwent, depending upon the seriousness of the affection, the associated diseases and the different reactiveness to the medical treatment, operation: in immediate emergency (26.1%); in postponed emergency (67.8%; in remote time (6.1%).

CD010339|9830579|Complex cystic duct is associated with cholelithiasis.|The relationship between complex cystic ducts and cholelithiasis has seldom been investigated quantitatively. Thus we attempted a retrospective survey on two case series with and without cholelithiasis in a university hospital. A total of 500 patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiography were reviewed, 250 of whom had cholelithiasis and another 250 no gallstones. They were sampled at random during the period from 1979 through 1993. Parameters including the length, inner diameter and configuration of the cystic duct, and the angle formed by the cystic duct, and the axis of the gallbladder were compared between the groups with or without cholelithiasis. The patients with gallstones has significantly (p < 0.001) longer and narrower cystic ducts (a mean of 48 mm and 4 mm in length and diameter, respectively) than did those without stones (a mean of 28 mm and 7 mm, respectively). Moreover, patients with gallstones showed a significantly (p < 0.001) more acute angle between the gallbladder and the cystic duct than those without (a mean angle of 84 degrees and 119 degrees respectively). The overall frequency of the disfigurements of the cystic duct was significantly higher in the group with gallstones (99%) than in the group without (29%).

CD010339|7280942|Histologic changes and intrahepatic biliary abnormalities in extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction.|To assess the role of extrahepatic biliary obstruction in the production of damage to the liver and biliary ductal apparatus, 100 patients underwent choledochoduodenostomy for malignant or benign extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Patients were observed by means of barium meal studies for one month to one year postoperatively. Emphasis was placed upon the relationship of the appearance, structure and function of the extrahepatic and intrahepatic biliary tree in these studies with the findings after histologic examination of the liver, gallbladder or commmon bile duct wall; liver function tests, and cultures of the bile. It has been shown that barium meal studies are an indicative criterion for the evaluation of the extent and progress of the hepatobiliary damage and of its further development after relief of the obstruction. It has been proved that chronic extrahepatic biliary obstruction of long standing seen in patients with a long history of symptoms, with a high incidence of primary common bile duct stones and with a high rate of contaminated bile as well as a high percentage of common bile duct dilation is a challenging and serious disease for both the patient and the hepatobiliary apparatus.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|18493421|Clinical study on causative factors and recurrence of choledocholithiasis.|To identify factors involved in choledocholithiasis, clinical characteristics were studied using univariate and multivariate analyses. Factors involved in recurrence were also investigated. The subjects consisted of 51 patients with calcium bilirubinate stones (B group) and 52 patients with cholesterol stones (C group). All patients had choledocholithiasis and underwent lithotripsy by endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) during the past 9 years. Twenty variables, including clinical symptoms and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) findings, were analyzed using a Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software package. Univariate analysis were done using Student's t-test and the chi-square test. Multivariate analyses were done by stepwise logistic regression analysis. In univariate analyses, there were significant differences between the B group and C group in nine variables: age, common bile duct diameter, common hepatic duct diameter, common bile duct stone diameter, cystic duct diameter, and the presence of gallbladder stones, atypical arrangement of the hepatic duct, parapapillary diverticulum, and large parapapillary diverticulum. In multivariate analysis, the four variables of no gallbladder stone, large parapapillary diverticulum, cystic duct less than 8 mm, and atypical arrangement of the hepatic duct were significant independent factors for the development of stones in the B group, with relative risks of 37.75, 16.73, 5.56, and 5.49, respectively. The results indicated that calcium bilirubinate stones were frequently associated with parapapillary diverticulum and abnormal arrangement of the bile duct. The formation of these stones was attributed to chronic biliary stasis caused by dysfunction of the biliary tract, including the papilla. In contrast, most cholesterol stones found in the common bile duct had apparently descended from the gallbladder. Common bile duct stones recurred after EST in 9 patients, all of whom had calcium bilirubinate stones. On ERCP, recurrence was found to be frequently associated with gallbladder stones, large parapapillary diverticula, and atypical arrangement of the hepatic duct. Patients with these characteristics on initial ERCP should therefore receive appropriate treatment and undergo strict follow-up observations owing to the increased risk of recurrence caused by dysfunction of the biliary tract.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|9830577|Spontaneous passage of gallbladder calculi--facilitation by endoscopic sphincterotomy.|After endoscopic sphincterotopy (ES) gallbladder motility increases leading to expulsion of crystals and stones. But this is not a universal phenomenon. We evaluated cholangiographic findings in patients emptying their gallbladder after ES for common bile duct (CBD) stones. Cholangiographic features of twenty patients expelling gallbladder calculi after ES were studied. Controls included 20 age and sex matched patients with gallstones and CBD stones, who did not expel gallstones after ES. Of 20 cases in study group, 9 recovered more than 20 stones each in the stool within 7 days of ES. Repeat ERCP showed empty gallbladder in all, whereas CBD was full of stones in 11 of the 20 cases. In the study group, low insertion of the cystic duct was more common (10 vs 0, p < 0.04), the cystic duct made a narrow angle (20 +/- 5 degrees vs 50 +/- 10 degrees, p < 0.04) with CBD before insertion and cystic duct diameter was higher (5 mm vs 2.5 mm, p < 0.04) as compared to controls. We conclude that in patients undergoing ES with intact gallbladder and small gallbladder calculi, spontaneous emptying of gallbladder calculi occurs, if cystic duct is wider, has low insertion and makes narrow angle with CBD before insertion.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

This can be done for essentially three reasons, namely to alleviate jaundice preoperatively, to provide permanent bile drainage in patients not amenable to surgery, and to relieve excess pressure in surgical anastomoses of the biliary passages. On the basis of biological considerations (relationship between severity and duration of cholestasis on the one hand and postoperative mortality and morbidity on the other), and in light of their own results, the authors argue in favor of this procedure, explaining that it is only mildly traumatic to the patient, easy to perform, attended by a low quota of complications, and above all effective as a drainage; also, it does not unduly prolong the preoperative period for patients scheduled for further and major surgery. Also in view of the current role of PTC in the diagnosis of obstructive jaundice, they submit that transhepatic-percutaneous drainage should be done right next to recognition of dilatation of the intrahepatic bile passages by CAT or echotomography.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

By using this radial-type probe introduced into a hard metal sheath with a balloon at the end, the plane containing Calot's triangle can be scanned easily when the gallbladder is extracted to the right side, thereby facilitating the identification of the cystic duct as well as the common ducts. In 30 cases, no common duct stone was found and the cystic duct was clearly identified.

CD010339|2277619|[A study on postoperative bile duct stricture with intrahepatic stones].|From January 1976 through December 1988 we encountered ninety nine cases of intrahepatic stones. Eight of them were complicated with postoperative bile duct strictures which were formed on cholangiojejunostomy in 5 cases, cholangioduodenostomy, hepatic hilum and common hepatic duct in 1 case, respectively. Six cases of them are anastomotic strictures. The stones were mainly composed of bilirubin calcium. We guessed that the bile duct stricture resulted from cholangiojejunostomy without Roux-en-Y in 1 case and anastomotic insufficiency in 5 cases. Intrahepatic stones were removed by percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (PTCS), and the treatment for the stricture was cholangiojejunostomy in 1 case and the dilatation by PTCS in 5 cases, including 3 endoprostheses by pig-tail silicone catheter and 2 internal-external biliary drainage. Two patients who did not undergo cholangioscopic dilatation died of sepsis due to cholangitis. Three of 5 patients who underwent endoscopic dilatation by PTCS could return to social life without recurrence of gallstones. In other two cases an endoprosthetic catheter was removed by PTCS because of dislodgement or obstruction of the catheter after confirming anastomotic strictures had improved.

Simultaneous scintigraphic-ultrasonographic techniques have been proposed to assess alternating phases of gallbladder emptying and filling. To evaluate patterns of gallbladder motility and of postprandial bile flow by means of a single ultrasonographic technique, 12 healthy volunteers and 20 gallstone patients underwent minute-by-minute gallbladder ultrasonography for 3 h postprandially. Mathematical analysis of volume measurements was used to estimate hepatic and cholecystic bile flux through the gallbladder. Compared to controls, gallstone patients showed greater amounts of unexchanged cholecystic-to-hepatic bile (11% vs. 1%, p <.001) and most of them showed impaired gallbladder washout efficacy. Utrasonographic values of bile exchanges were similar to those derived from scintigraphic-sonographic studies in comparable groups of subjects. This study provides new ultrasonographic variables, which better express gallbladder bile retention in gallstone patients and strongly discriminate gallstone patients from controls.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|8322123|The evaluation and management of known or suspected stones of the common bile duct in the era of minimal access surgery.|Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has rapidly become the procedure of choice for symptomatic cholelithiasis. The perioperative diagnosis and modern treatment of suspected stones of the common bile duct (CBD) remains controversial. A database of 573 patients undergoing LC was compiled during an 11 month period. Sixty-seven patients (47 females, 20 males) (13 percent) were suspected of having CBD stones based upon clinical, laboratory and roentgenographic evidence. Fifty-two patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ER-CP) (45 preoperative and seven postoperative). Seventeen patients were studied with intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC). The indications for cholangiography (either ERCP or IOC) included pancreatitis (group 1), clinical history suggestive of CBD stones, but normal preoperative liver function tests (LFT) (group 2), cholangitis (group 3), grossly abnormal LFT (group 4) and dilated CBD (greater than 7 millimeters on sonogram) (group 5). The incidence of CBD stones was three of 14 (21 percent) in group 1, six of 20 (30 percent) in group 2, two of three (67 percent) in group 3, 16 of 26 (62 percent) in group 4 and two of four (50 percent) in group 5. Overall, 29 patients (23 females and six males) had stones retrieved from the CBD. Of the 52 ERCP, 20 endoscopic sphincterotomies were performed for documented CBD stones. Of the group that had pre-LC ERCP, three (6 percent) ultimately required an open procedure. There were three instances of post-ERCP pancreatitis (6 percent) and ERCP was not able to opacify or clear the CBD in four instances. Seven patients had postoperative ERCP with successful retrieval of retained CBD stones (100 percent). Of the 17 IOC, eight were positive--two patients underwent laparoscopic clearance of the CBD and six required conversion to an open procedure. There were no deaths or extensive complications. Total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase were independently related to the presence of a CBD stone, while demographic data, past medical history, preoperative symptoms, leukocyte count, vital signs, amylase, serum glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase nuclear scintigraphic visualization of the duodenum or size of CBD on sonography, were not. No patient with biliary pancreatitis had CBD stones without abnormalities in the LFT or the preoperative sonogram. ERCP is a useful technique to clear the CBD pre-LC. However, ERCP in patients with biliary pancreatitis, but otherwise normal preoperative tests, has a low yield. In this group of patients, IOC is an appropriate alternative to pre-LC ERCP.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|1209273|Nuclear medicine and ultrasound; correlation in diagnosis of disease of liver and biliary tract.|Even though the radiocolloid scan is nonspecific it will be approximately 70%-80% accurate in predicting the presence or absence of liver disease and somewhat less accurate than that in making statements as to the specific type of disease. This compares well with other modalities. The ability of nuclear medicine techniques to provide a correct diagnosis is improved when additional isotopic techniques such as hepatic blood flow studies and 131I-rose bengal and 67Ga scanning are performed. Ultrasound scanning is also non specific. To date, the major application of ultrasound in the study of the liver has been in deciphering puzzling contour abnormalities seen on nuclear medicine scans and in demonstrating fluid-filled abnormalities. Its usefulness in diffuse and solid focal lesions has been less dramatic. More recently, however, the development of gray scale has necessitated a reevaluation of the technique. Gray scale demonstrates a large number of intrahepatic interfaces that were previously invisible, and it has already been shown to demonstrate focal disorders such as metastasis more easily than the nongray-scale method. It can also demonstrate dilated biliary radicals, the gallbladder, and gallstones. In addition, while routinely studying the liver one can evaluate diaphragmatic motion and various retroperitoneal structures such as the pancreas, lymph nodes, and abdominal vascular structures.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Controversies regarding management were analyzed. The majority of the patients with biliary tract malformation required radical operation initially. Regarding postoperative complications, however, non-surgical managements; PTCD, endoscopic lithotomy for remaining calculi, endoscopic injection sclerotherapy for esophageal varices or PSE (partial splenic embolization) for portal hypertension, are preferred. The optimal time to treat the patients; biliary atresia--within 2 mo. for Kasai operation, choledochal cyst depends on the patient's symptom-onset, but extrahepatic biliary tract perforations may occasionally occur in infants, then antenatal ultrasonography (US) is necessary. Five infants out of 8 patients with choledochal dilatation due to congenital duodenal obstruction and annular pancreas were successfully treated following duodenal surgery alone, however a 18 yr-old female with this lesion underwent biliary tract reconstruction because of irreversible biliary tract dilatation. The preferred management we recommend; 1) pre-or intraoperative diagnosis using US, cholangiography or intraoperative direct probe survey of the biliary or pancreatic duct, 2) accurate surgery with complete excision of the cyst or biliary stenosis plasty with adequate anastomosis, 3) a sustained long-term follow-up study utilizing US.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones

In conjunction with conventional imaging such as helical computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, the indications for EUS include (1) differentiating between benign and malignant lesions of the mediastinum and upper GI tract, (2) staging malignant tumors of the lung, esophagus, stomach, and pancreas prior to surgery or oncological treatment, (3) excluding common bile duct stones before laparoscopic cholecystectomy, thereby avoiding the need for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in some patients, and (4) assessing suspected lesions that are either equivocal or not seen on conventional imaging. In recent years, EUS has charted a course similar to that taken by ERCP, evolving from a purely diagnostic modality to one that is interventional and therapeutic. These indications include (5) obtaining a tissue diagnosis by EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration or trucut-type needle biopsy and (6) providing therapy such as coeliac plexus neurolysis and pancreatic pseudocyst drainage--in many cases, more accurately and safely than conventional techniques.

Breast carcinoma has the potential for widespread dissemination, such as metastasis to axillary lymph nodes, bone, lung, pleura, brain, and soft tissues. Liver, gastrointestinal, and biliary tract involvement are infrequent. We report a patient, a 62-year-old woman, with symptomatic cholelithiasis. The patient proceeded to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. She had a previous history of mastectomy with axillary lymphadenectomy, performed for a breast ductal papillary carcinoma, 10 years prior to the cholecystectomy. The gallbladder was hydropic; the wall was thickened, with a focal broad-based lesion on the mesenteric face of the body. Histopathological evaluation of the focal broad-based lesion of the gallbladder revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma infiltration, without mucosal involvement. Subsequent immunohistochemical examination showed the lesion to be cytokeratin 7(CK7)-positive and cytokeratin 20 (CK20)-negative. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) were positive. The final pathological diagnosis was breast ductal papillary carcinoma metastases to the gallbladder. Mammography of the other breast was normal. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed, without any pathological findings. Bone Tc-99 scintigraphy was normal. Six months after the surgery positron emission tomography (PET) showed no evidence of metastatic disease. Two years after the surgery, the patient died, in the absence of recurrence.

She had a previous history of mastectomy with axillary lymphadenectomy, performed for a breast ductal papillary carcinoma, 10 years prior to the cholecystectomy. The gallbladder was hydropic; the wall was thickened, with a focal broad-based lesion on the mesenteric face of the body. Histopathological evaluation of the focal broad-based lesion of the gallbladder revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma infiltration, without mucosal involvement. Subsequent immunohistochemical examination showed the lesion to be cytokeratin 7(CK7)-positive and cytokeratin 20 (CK20)-negative. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) were positive. The final pathological diagnosis was breast ductal papillary carcinoma metastases to the gallbladder. Mammography of the other breast was normal. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed, without any pathological findings. Bone Tc-99 scintigraphy was normal. Six months after the surgery positron emission tomography (PET) showed no evidence of metastatic disease. Two years after the surgery, the patient died, in the absence of recurrence. A literature review revealed only a few more cases of metastasic breast carcinoma to the gallbladder.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones
CD010339|17139436|Porcelain gallbladder complicated with pancreas divisum.|We report a rare case of porcelain gallbladder associated with pancreas divisum (PD). A 60-year-old woman suffered from discomfort in the back of the right side. An abdominal radiograph revealed a calcified spherical mass in the right upper quadrant. Ultrasonography revealed a scattered echo with a posterior acoustic shadow in the gallbladder wall. A plain computed tomography (CT) scan showed flecks of intramural calcification in the wall of the gallbladder. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed separate openings for the Santorini and Wirsung ducts. The patient underwent cholecystectomy after porcelain gallbladder and pancreas divisum had been diagnosed. The porcelain gallbladder resulted from a stone impacted in the neck of the gallbladder. Patients with PD should be followed carefully, because gallstones often accompany PD, and porcelain gallbladder may result, as in this patient.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|6390756|Twenty-two year experience with the diagnosis and treatment of intrahepatic calculi.|Intrahepatic cholelithiasis is commonly associated with suppurative cholangitis and occurs equally in males and females. Patients usually present with a history of recurrent symptoms and a differential diagnosis which includes viral hepatitis, pancreatitis, myocardial infarction and perforated ulcer. Cholangiography including stereocholangiography is essential for localizing intrahepatic stones and ductal strictures. The guiding operative principle is to drain all infected bile distal to ducts obstructed with stones or stricture. This may also necessitate a bilioenterostomy with or without partial hepatic resection. Although these procedures are formidable in an acutely ill patient, a more simple but inappropriate choledocholithotomy and t-tube drainage done proximal to an obstructed intrahepatic duct will be ineffective and may result in continued sepsis and death.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|11606863|Acute hepatitis E virus infection presenting as a prolonged cholestatic jaundice.|Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an enteric virus that usually causes a self-resolving hepatitis; although, it may be fatal, especially in pregnant women. Although HEV is endemic in Israel, there have been no recent local outbreaks. We report the case of a 70-year-old man who presented with painless jaundice. Ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography scan revealed gallstones, with no evidence of cholecystitis and no dilatation of the intra-or extrahepatic bile ducts. An open cholecystectomy was performed with intraoperative cholangiography. There was no evidence of choledocholithiasis. A subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was normal. His bilirubin level subsequently increased to a maximum of 25 mg/dL, and his gamma-glutamyl-transferase level reached 1,400 U/L. There was no evidence of any autoimmune or metabolic disease, and routine viral serology was normal except for immunoglobulin G to hepatitis A virus. A liver biopsy revealed an acute cholestatic picture. The jaundice resolved slowly after a period of 6 months. Hepatitis E virus RNA was isolated from the acute-phase serum and was not detectable in the convalescent serum. This case is a unique example of chronic cholestatic jaundice that we think is caused by acute HEV infection.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|6532038|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with jaundice and suspected biliary obstruction.|During a 4-year period (1978-1982), 206 patients were examined with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) because of jaundice with suspected biliary obstruction. The total of examinations was 223. Duodenoscopy with ERCP gave a positive primary diagnosis in 160 cases (78%), six (4%) of which later proved to be incorrect. Extrahepatic obstruction could be excluded in 16 patients with normal cholangiogram (8%). Clinically relevant information thus was obtained in 176 cases (85%). The main cause of extrahepatic obstruction was common bile duct stone(s), which were found in 73 patients. Immediate endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed in 64 of them and cleared the duct of stones in 54 (84%). Benign stenosis of the ampulla of Vater was relieved with endoscopic sphincterotomy in six patients. Malignant bile duct obstruction was diagnosed in 56 patients, and in three of them an endoprosthesis for internal drainage of the biliary tract was endoscopically inserted. Immediate complications after ERCP without endoscopic sphincterotomy occurred in 5 of 136 patients (4%), one of whom died.

Management of common bile duct stones in the era of laparoscopy is an area of controversy. Although perioperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography remains as a widely used procedure, experience is accumulating on the exploration of the common bile duct with the laparoscope. A biliary drainage procedure is indicated in selected patients with choledocholithiasis. Initially described by Reidel in 1892, side-to-side choledochoduodenostomy has become a popular biliary-enteric anastomosis technique in the last century. We describe two patients with recurrent choledocholithiasis and biliary obstruction due to benign biliary strictures. Both patients underwent laparoscopic common bile duct exploration and stone extraction. A side-to-side choledochoduodenostomy is then performed laparoscopically as a drainage procedure. Laparoscopic choledochoduodenostomy resulted in resolution of jaundice and relief of biliary obstruction. Laparoscopic choledochoduodenostomy can be an acceptable alternative to the open choledochoduodenostomy. In addition to a tension-free anastomosis and an adequate-sized stoma, intracorporeal suturing and knot-tying skills are also essential to the success of this procedure.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Over a period of four years, 1105 consecutive patients had laparoscopic cholecystectomy. All patients, in addition to their clinical assessment, had routine liver function tests (LFTs) and ultrasound (US) examination of the biliary tract. Preoperative ERCP was performed (diagnostic and/or therapeutic) in 107 (9.6%) of the patients. The indications for ERCP were one or more of the following: 1) abnormal liver function test, 74 patients; 2) jaundice, 37 patients; 3) common bile duct (CBD) stone seen in US, 36 patients, and/or CBD dilatation, 46 patients; and 4) pancreatitis, 20 patients. In 41 out of 107 (38%) patients, CBD stones were present and cleared endoscopically. Postoperative ERCP was necessary in eight patients: to remove retained stones in the CBD (two patients), to stop bile leak (two patients), and to investigate the persistent abnormal LFTs in the remaining patients. The number of patients who had evidence of retained CBD stone following laparoscopic cholecystectomy was only two. In both patients, endoscopic removal was successful. Therefore, it is clear that operative cholangiography in laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not essential if there is a reasonable facility for ERCP.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The most common cause of failure was inability to perform ES (12 patients). After ES, only two patients needed early surgery for obstruction. One more patient was operated on because the stone was too big for extraction or spontaneous passing.--Ten patients with probably retained stones after ES were followed for six months to three years. Bile duct obstruction recurred in three of them: two were treated successfully with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and one underwent repeated ES and stone extraction. The complication rate was low. One female patient died of Legionella pneumonia, but the relationship between the death and the procedure remained uncertain. One female patient needed emergency surgery for massive bleeding: she recovered normally. Nasobiliary drain or any kind of stenting were not used and there was no case of cholangitis after ES.

CD010339|414634|Operative fluoroscopy and cholangiography. The use of modern radiologic technics during surgery.|Operative cholangiography as currently performed in many hospitals in the United States may be a cumbersome procedure yielding less than optimal information. For maximal accuracy and diagnostic yield, operative radiographic examination of the biliary tract should include fluoroscopic observation and aimed spot films. The advantages gained by using modern radiologic equipment and technics are increased image clarity, increased capability for functional assessment of a dynamic system, increased efficiency, and decreased radiation hazard. In a series of 100 patients undergoing operative cholangiography by our technic, only one retained stone was demonstrated by postoperative studies. Five anomalies of the ductal system were easily identified and possible injury to the anomalous ducts averted. Considering the morbidity and mortality attendant upon inadequate or inappropriate biliary tract operations, investment in the sophisticated equipment necessary for optimal operative radiography is small indeed.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|23180936|Portal biliopathy.|Biliary ductal changes are a common radiological finding in patients with portal hypertension, however only a small percentage of patients (5%-30%) develop symptomatic bile duct obstruction. The exact pathogenesis is not clear, but an involvement of factors such as bile duct compression by venous collaterals, ischemia, and infection is accepted by most authors. Although endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was used to define and diagnose this condition, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is currently the investigation of choice for diagnosing this condition. Treatment is indicated only for symptomatic cases. Portosystemic shunts are the treatment of choice for symptomatic portal biliopathy. In the majority of patients, the changes caused by biliopathy resolve after shunt surgery, however, 15%-20% patients require a subsequent bilio-enteric bypass or endoscopic management for persistent biliopathy. There is a role for endoscopic therapy in patients with bile duct stones, cholangitis or when portosystemic shunt surgery is not feasible.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Radiologic findings of seven patients with histologically proven xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis were reviewed retrospectively. Sonography showed a calculus or calculi of the gallbladder with moderate thickening of the wall in all. IV cholangiography was performed in six cases. Findings were nonspecific. Four had nonopacified gallbladder, and one had stenosis of the proximal part of the common bile duct. Marked thickening of the gallbladder wall was seen in six of seven cases on CT. In one case the thickened wall was lobulated and irregular. The border between the gallbladder and the adjacent liver was unclear in two and relatively clear in five. Four patients underwent angiography to evaluate the possibility of tumor. Two of them had irregularity and stenosis of the cystic artery highly suggestive of carcinoma. The other two showed only dilatation of the cystic artery. On the basis of all radiologic studies, carcinoma was diagnosed preoperatively in two of the seven cases. Radiologically, xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis may best be regarded as a tumor-like condition and should be included in the differential diagnosis of gallbladder cancer.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|15519599|The flow of bile in the human cystic duct.|Clinical studies suggest that the flow of bile in the biliary system may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of cholelithiasis, but little is known about its transport mechanism. This paper reports a numerical study of steady flow in human cystic duct models. In order to obtain parametric data on the effects of various anatomical features in the cystic duct, idealised models were constructed, first with staggered baffles in a channel to represent the valves of Heister and lumen. The qualitative consistency of these findings are validated by modelling two of the real cystic ducts obtained from operative cholangiograms. Three-dimensional (3D) models were also constructed to further verify the two-dimensional (2D) results. It was found that the most significant geometric parameter affecting resistance is the baffle clearance (lumen size), followed by the number of baffles (number of folds in the valves of Heister), whilst the least significant ones are the curvature of the cystic duct and the angle between the neck and the gallbladder. The study presented here forms part of a larger project to understand the functions of the human cystic duct, especially the influence of its various anatomical structures on the resistance to bile flow, so that it may aid the assessment of the risk of stone formation in the gallbladder.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Statistical analysis showed no significant differences in gallbladder contractility between the fragment-free group and the residual-fragment group before (77.2 +/- 12.7% vs. 71.9 +/- 19.3%; p = 0.1044) biliary lithotripsy and after the termination of adjuvant cholelitholysis therapy (76.4 +/- 12.9% vs. 72.2 +/- 17.1%; p = 0.1341). Before treatment, there was no significant difference in fasting gallbladder volume in either group (29.9 +/- 15.4 ml vs. 36.6 +/- 18.8; p = 0.0682), but postprandial gallbladder volume was greater in nonresponders (10.4 +/- 9.4 ml vs. 6.5 +/- 3.8; p = 0.0164).

The machines used were a Piezolith 2300, which generates shock waves by the piezoceramic principle, and a Dornier MPL 9000, which produces the shock waves by underwater spark discharge. With each machine, corresponding stones of 45 pairs of weight and volume matched calculi (median volume 0.5 cm3, median diameter 10.5 mm) obtained at cholecystectomy were treated. All stones were successfully disintegrated (fragments smaller than 2 mm) with up to 5400 (median 628) shocks with the Piezolith and 3450 (median 428) shocks with the MPL 9000 lithotripters. With the Piezolith, operating at the highest power setting, a 1.65 fold median higher number of shocks was required for stone fragmentation than with the MPL 9000 at a medium power setting. Stone volume seemed to be the only determinant which affected ease of fragmentation; composition and density of the stones as assessed by computed tomography did not seem to be governing factors.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|20590778|Alternative methods in the endoscopic management of difficult common bile duct stones.|The endoscopic method is accepted as a first treatment modality in the management of extrahepatic bile duct. Most large stones can be removed with basket and mechanical lithotripsy after endoscopic sphincterotomy. Currently, in treating large extrahepatic bile duct stones, endoscopic papillary large balloon dilation with mid-incision endoscopic sphincterotomy is actively performed instead of applying mechanical lithotripsy after full endoscopic sphincterotomy. Herein, we describe the conceptions, proper indications, methods and complications of endoscopic papillary large balloon dilation with regards to currently published reports. In addition, intracorporeal lithotripsy by peroral cholangioscopy with an ultra-slim upper endoscope is introduced, which is more convenient than previous conventional intracorporeal lithotripsy methods using mother-baby endoscopy or percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy. Lastly, biliary stenting with the choleretic agent administration method is briefly reviewed as an alternative treatment option for frail and elderly patients with large impacted common bile duct stones.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|20590779|Evaluation of residual bile duct stones by peroral cholangioscopy in comparison with balloon-cholangiography.|We evaluated the usefulness of peroral cholangioscopy (POCS) for residual bile duct stones in patients with complete bile duct clearance confirmed by balloon-occluded cholangiography. A total of 108 patients with common bile duct stones who underwent POCS after extraction of stones via endoscopic sphincterotomy, resulting in complete bile duct extraction confirmed by balloon-occluded cholangiography, were retrospectively evaluated. For the treatment of difficult stones, stones were fragmented by mechanical lithotripsy (ML) or electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL). In 26 patients (24%), residual stones were detected with POCS in the lower bile duct. In patients with residual stones, large bile duct stones, juxtapapillary diverticulum, and use of ML or EHL were significantly related to residual stones (P < 0.05). Although a prospective study is necessary to clarify whether this procedure is appropriate in aspects of cost and benefits, POCS appears to be a useful diagnostic tool for confirming complete extraction of bile duct stones. POCS may be useful, particularly when lithotripsy using ML or EHL is performed and a large pneumobilia exists in the bile duct.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Five patients with this syndrome were encountered over a 5-year period. Pain or cholangitis was the clinical presentation in four patients, whereas one patient presented with secondary septic arthritis and a hepatic abscess. Liver function tests were mildly abnormal in each patient. All patients had a stomal size of less than 1 cm as assessed by forward- or side-viewing endoscopy. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed either stones or debris in the distal common bile ducts of all patients. Four patients had a surgical clearance of their duct with concurrent closure of the choledochoduodenostomy in three patients and the creation of a Rouxen-Y end-to-side choledochojejunostomy in the fourth patient. The other patient had an endoscopic sphincterotomy performed. After 1-4 years of follow-up, four patients have had a total resolution of symptoms. The other patient with follow-up for 4 years has had one episode of cholangitis which resolved rapidly with antibiotic treatment.

CD010339|1403510|Cholelithiasis in newborns and infants.|Cholelithiasis in infants is rare, and has usually been associated with hemolysis, ileal disease, congenital anomalies of the biliary tree, hyperalimentation, and prolonged fasting. With the increased use of abdominal ultrasonography (US), more cases of cholelithiasis are being discovered. We report our experience with 13 infants diagnosed on abdominal US to have gallstones. There were 9 boys and 4 girls with an average age at diagnosis of 2.6 months (range, 0 to 9 months). Predisposing factors could be identified in only 6 of the 13 patients. Two patients with obstructive jaundice underwent cholecystectomy and common bile duct exploration. One patient with choledocolithiasis and common bile duct dilatation was observed. His stone passed spontaneously, with resolution of symptoms. Ten patients without cholestasis remained asymptomatic, with disappearance of lithiasis in five of them. Neonatal cholelithiasis is more common than previously suspected; it seems to affect males more often than females and is usually not associated with known predisposing factors. It appears to be a temporary, self-limiting phenomenon, and an aggressive approach is not warranted in the asymptomatic infant. Surgical or radiological intervention should be reserved for the symptomatic patients or those with underlying lithogenic disorders.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|6656238|Critical factors in the image clarity of operative cholangiography.|To evaluate image clarity in operative cholangiography with changing radiographic variables, in vitro experiments were performed in which 1-mm radiographically nonopaque biliary calculi in tubes were examined. Variables changed in these studies were tube caliber (6, 13 and 20 mm), contrast concentration (15, 30, and 60%), X-ray exposures (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 mAs) and location of calculi (central or peripheral). Sensitivity for the detection of calculi and the clarity of contrast radiographic images depended upon these variables. Reduced contrast concentration or increased radiographic exposure were needed for large caliber tubes. Central small calculi required more exposure than peripheral calculi. Practical inferences from these studies can be summarized as guidelines for performing operative cholangiography: (1) Surgeons should become aware of exposure settings used on the radiographic equipment in the operating room. In particular, the milliampere-seconds-setting is an important variable. (2) Normal size and slightly enlarged ducts should be injected with 30% radiographic contrast. (3) Ducts which are 20 mm or more in diameter should be injected with 15% contrast. (4) Variable radiographic exposures may be necessary to demonstrate centrally and peripherally located calculi, especially for small calculi in large ducts.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The authors believe the transcholecystic approach is a useful alternative to transhepatic cholangiography.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones
CD010339|1300846|[Prevalence of gallbladder lithiasis in a Uruguayan population].|Ultrasound examinations were carried out in 693 volunteers from the health care personnel of the Hospital de Clinicas of Montevideo, with the aim of studying the prevalence of gallbladder gallstones in Uruguay, the proportion of symptomatic and asymptomatic people and its association to some definite risk factors. The prevalence found was 10.4%, which, according to the sample's size, is representative of the general population with a confidence of 99%. Sixty five per cent of gallstones carriers were asymptomatic. A statistically significant association with the following factors was found: people between 31 and 50 years old, slight obesity, and, for women, to have children. A marked tendency with the following factors was found, though it was not statistically significant: female sex, and a familiar history of mother carrying gallstones. Considering all these factors as a whole, the probability of having gallstones reached 19%. Results are discussed and compared with those of foreign publications. It is concluded that uruguayan people with more possibilities of having gallstones are: women between 31 and 50 years old, obese, with children, and whose mother has or had the same disease.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|21425044|Outcome of emergency ERCP in the intensive care unit.|There are limited data on the outcome of emergency endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) performed in the intensive care unit (ICU). We sought to assess the frequency, indications, and clinical outcomes of ERCPs performed in ICU patients who were too unstable to be transported to the endoscopy unit. An electronic endoscopy database was used to identify the patients (n = 22) and to assess procedural success, complications, and mortality. The indications for ERCP included suspected biliary sepsis, suspected gallstone pancreatitis, and known choledocholithiasis with cholangitis. Biliary cannulation, which was attempted in all patients, was successful in 19 patients (86 %), and of these 18 (95 %) underwent a technically successful endoscopic therapy. There were no apparent endoscopic complications. Therefore, emergency bedside ERCP in ICU patients, which is primarily performed for the management of suspected biliary sepsis and gallstone pancreatitis, can achieve high technical success rates when performed by experienced endoscopists, although the 30-day mortality rate remains high due to multiorgan dysfunction.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|8167876|Intraoperative sonography of biliary tree during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.|The use of routine cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is still under debate. Previous reports have suggested that intraoperative sonography can replace cholangiography in the evaluation of common duct lithiasis during open cholecystectomy. The present study was performed to evaluate the possible role of sonography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Thirty patients underwent intraoperative sonography of the biliary tree during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In cases with a diagnosis of common bile duct lithiasis, intraoperative cholangiography was performed. In 26 cases, sonography did not show the presence of stones; in three cases, stones were identified at both sonography and cholangiography; in one case, stones were diagnosed by sonography alone. In this last case, stones were confirmed on later review of cholangiogram. No complications related to the method were observed. We suggest that intraoperative sonography can represent an adequate substitute for intraoperative cholangiography as a screening procedure for stone identification during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|8403762|Radiological aspects of solvent dissolution of gall-stones.|Twenty-five patients were referred for solvent dissolution of gall-stones using methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). All patients were assessed beforehand by ultrasound and oral cholecystography. Computed tomography was performed in 23 patients to assess stone calcification and gall-bladder anatomy. Successful stone dissolution was achieved in 15 patients and partial dissolution in six patients. Failure to catheterize the gall-bladder occurred in four patients. There were four biliary leaks, two requiring cholecystectomy. The CT appearances of the gall-bladder may have predicted problems with catheterization in three of the four cases, and the results suggest that cover of the gall-bladder by the liver of greater than 50% is a favourable predictor of successful catheterization. A thick-walled gall-bladder and excess fat between the liver and the lateral abdominal wall are adverse predictors of successful gall-bladder catheterization. Both tubography and ultrasound should be used to assess progress of dissolution. Newer, more effective solvents together with increased expertise in interventional techniques may encourage the more widespread use of solvent dissolution of gall-stones as an alternative to surgery in a selected population.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The category which demonstrated a normal sonographic gallbladder, namely a smooth wall and no internal echos, contained a number of false negatives which proved to have either small stone cholelithiasis or extraphepatic ductal obstruction. Within the described limitations, the B-scan can be a valuable test in confirming the significance of a radiographically nonvisualized gallbladder or in detecting a biliary tract lesion in a patient with a disease entity that precludes radiographic visualization by conventional techniques.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

In six patients, the stones disappeared. However, in two of the patients, the stones did not disappear, and they were removed with the ureteral basket. Infusion of cholate sodium was well tolerated by six patients, but was accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain in two patients. In one case, mucosal deformity of the common bile duct was noticed during the infusion, but it was not apparent on a subsequent cholangiogram. As a result of our experience, we conclude that cholate sodium infusion is a safe procedure for the attempted dissolution of retained common bile duct stones.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|2914651|Pancreaticobiliary ductal union in biliary diseases. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic study.|To assess whether the anatomy of the pancreaticobiliary ductal drainage into the duodenum has any relationship with biliary diseases we analyzed 259 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatograms. These included 102 normal examinations (control group), 95 patients with gallstone disease, and 21 patients with carcinoma of the gallbladder. In the control group, 64 (63%) subjects had a common channel and 38 (37%) had separated openings for the common bile duct and the main pancreatic duct. By contrast, the prevalence rate of a common channel was significantly lower in gallstone disease [28 (30%); p less than 0.001]. No such difference, compared with controls, was observed in patients with carcinoma of the gallbladder. The length of the common channel in the control group (mean +/- SD, 4.7 +/- 2.5 mm) was similar to that in gallstone disease (4.6 +/- 2.6 mm). However, patients with carcinoma of the gallbladder had a significantly longer common channel (8.3 +/- 4 mm; p less than 0.001) compared with the control group. An abnormally long common channel (greater than or equal to 8 mm) was seen more frequently in carcinoma of the gallbladder (8 of 21; 38%) compared with normal subjects (3 of 102; 3%) and patients with gallstones (1 of 95; 1%); the difference was highly significant (p less than 0.001 for each). These observations suggest a close association between the anatomy of the distal ends of the common bile duct and main pancreatic duct and the development of gallstones and carcinoma of the gallbladder.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Continuous bile leak was observed beginning on the first postoperative day. Postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed bile leak through the common hepatic duct, and severe stenosis of the hepatic confluence. A total of three percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) catheters were inserted to treat obstructive jaundice and cholangitis. The patient was referred to our hospital for surgery 118 days after LC. Cholangiography through the PTBD catheters demonstrated a hilar biliary obstruction. Celiac arteriography revealed obstruction of the right hepatic artery, and transarterial portography showed occlusion of the right anterior portal branch. On the basis of the cholangiographic and angiographic findings, we performed a right hepatic lobectomy with hepaticojejunostomy to resolve the bile duct obstruction and address the problem of major vascular occlusion. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful and she remains well 25 months after hepatectomy. We discuss a treatment strategy for bile duct injury suspected after LC, involving early investigation of the biliary tree and prompt intervention.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

On the basis of the cholangiographic and angiographic findings, we performed a right hepatic lobectomy with hepaticojejunostomy to resolve the bile duct obstruction and address the problem of major vascular occlusion. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful and she remains well 25 months after hepatectomy. We discuss a treatment strategy for bile duct injury suspected after LC, involving early investigation of the biliary tree and prompt intervention.|0|Ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosis of common bile duct stones
CD011549|10664296|Right hepatic lobectomy for bile duct injury associated with major vascular occlusion after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.|A 57-year-old woman underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for cholelithiasis. Continuous bile leak was observed beginning on the first postoperative day. Postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed bile leak through the common hepatic duct, and severe stenosis of the hepatic confluence. A total of three percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) catheters were inserted to treat obstructive jaundice and cholangitis. The patient was referred to our hospital for surgery 118 days after LC. Cholangiography through the PTBD catheters demonstrated a hilar biliary obstruction. Celiac arteriography revealed obstruction of the right hepatic artery, and transarterial portography showed occlusion of the right anterior portal branch.

CD009323|8506963|Spectrum and management of major complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.|Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the most prevalent method of treating uncomplicated, symptomatic cholelithiasis in the United States and elsewhere. As experience with this procedure grows, certain pitfalls are becoming apparent. Since October 1990, we have treated 22 patients for major injuries incurred during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, including 15 women and 7 men (range: 23 to 85 years). One patient had previous upper abdominal surgery; no other patient had any relative contraindication to laparoscopic surgery. The most frequent site of injury (19 patients) was the extrahepatic biliary tract. There was one fatal duodenal perforation. All but two patients whose injuries went unrecognized at laparoscopy were symptomatic during the immediate postoperative period. The biliary injuries included complete transection of the common hepatic or common bile duct in 10 patients, complete ductal occlusion in 3, a cystic duct stump leak in 2, and a partially retained gallbladder with a contained intraperitoneal bile leak in 2. The site and extent of biliary injuries were delineated with transhepatic or endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. Reconstruction or repair of the biliary tract was accomplished with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy or cholangiojejunostomy in 11 and 1 patients, respectively, completion cholecystectomy in 2, and temporary transhepatic stenting, primary choledochocholedochostomy, and primary choledochorrhaphy over a T-tube in 1 patient each. One patient with a cystic duct stump leak was managed successfully with endoscopic sphincterotomy, whereas another required operative ligation. Laparoscopic injuries during cholecystectomy can lead to serious morbidity and mortality, thus emphasizing the need for adequate training and credentialing for surgeons and for a heightened clinical awareness of the potential complications, their long-term sequelae, and how to avoid them.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

One hundred forty-one symptomatic patients with one to three gallstones 5-30 mm in diameter were randomized to treatment. One week before ESWL, patients were given either UDCA or placebo. This treatment was continued for 6 months. All patients underwent follow-up at predetermined intervals. According to the protocol, re-treatment for fragments larger than 5 mm in diameter could be performed only at 6 weeks; 26 (18%) of the 141 patients were retreated. At 6 months, the stone-free rates for single stones were as follows: patients with noncalcified stones receiving UDCA, 29%; patients with noncalcified stones receiving placebo, 24%; and patients with partially calcified stones receiving either UDCA or placebo, 6%. No significant difference was noted between the UDCA and placebo groups. At 6 months, the stone-free rates in patients with single, noncalcified stones 20 mm or less in diameter were 40% (UDCA) and 32% (placebo), which is superior to rates for those with solitary, noncalcified gallstones 21-30 mm in diameter and those with two or three stones.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Ideally, the goal of successful treatment is the passage of all fragments from the gallbladder into the intestinal tract. Biliary colic has been reported in up to 35% of treated patients, although complications such as cholecystitis, cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, and pancreatitis are surprisingly infrequent. Cholescintigraphy is the procedure of choice in patients with biliary colic and suspected acute cholecystitis. It has proven to be more sensitive than ultrasound in detecting acute common bile duct (CBD) obstruction, since functional obstruction precedes morphologic dilatation of the CBD.

CD010339|20531057|A possible case of saw palmetto-induced pancreatitis.|A 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, Barrett esophagitis, and chronic gastritis developed acute pancreatitis after taking one week of the herbal medicine, saw palmetto, for symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Ultrasound and computed tomography ruled out cholelithiasis and obstruction, triglycerides were normal, and he had no recent infection or trauma. He had a history of occasional alcohol consumption, though there was no recent increased intake. The most likely cause of pancreatitis in this case was saw palmetto. Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) is an herbal medication used primarily in the treatment of symptoms related to BPH. It has a high content of fatty acids and phytosterols which are thought to exert their effects by inhibiting the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, thereby preventing the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has been postulated that saw palmetto directly stimulates estrogenic receptors and inhibits progesterone receptors in the prostate tissue. A previous report implicated the estrogen/antiandrogen properties of saw palmetto as inducing hepatotoxicity in a patient. Additionally, it has also been postulated that stimulation of the estrogenic receptors may lead to increased triglyceride levels or induction of a hypercoagulable state that leads to pancreatic necrosis. Finally, inhibition of cyclooxygenase, a property of saw palmetto, may be linked to acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis, a serious and sometimes fatal disorder may occur secondary to medications. Although the mechanism is not fully known, this is the second case of acute pancreatitis that has been documented secondary to the herbal medication saw palmetto. It is important for clinicians to obtain detailed medication histories, including over-the-counter and herbal medications, in order to prevent further complications from occurring.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Its role has been expanded to treat choledocholithiasis in patients with gallbladders still in place. The authors report their experience with endoscopic sphincterotomy, with emphasis on the safety of the procedure, in high-operative-risk patients with choledocholithiasis and gallbladder in situ. Stones were successfully removed in 72 of 75 patients (96%); 1 required an emergency operation and 2 an elective one. Complications included bleeding, pancreatitis and cholangitis; there were no associated deaths. Follow-up of 54 of the patients, who had associated cholelithiasis at the time of endoscopic sphincterotomy, showed that 14 died of causes unrelated to the biliary tract. Of the others, 14 underwent cholecystectomy for failure of endoscopic sphincterotomy (2), acute cholecystitis (4) or persistent biliary tract symptoms (8). The other 26 patients were well after a mean follow-up of 30.4 months; 1 had mild biliary tract symptoms. Ultrasonography in 16 of the 26 patients showed persistent cholelithiasis in 12.

CD009323|10695743|Surgical treatment of biliary tract infections.|"Despite major advances in surgical and nonsurgical therapy, biliary tract infections remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The two classic biliary tract infections most commonly encountered are acute cholecystitis (either calculous or acalculous) and acute cholangitis. In addition, bile leakage associated with bile duct injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become a problem not infrequently encountered by surgeons. Acute calculous cholecystitis results from a combination of mechanical, biochemical, and infectious mechanisms, initiated by stone impaction in the cystic duct. After instituting empiric antibiotics, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed. Although conversion to open cholecystectomy is more common than in chronic cholecystitis, there appears to be no increased morbidity or mortality in that setting. Acute acalculous cholecystitis usually occurs in critically ill patients and may present both a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. Aggressive management, however, is warranted, both because of the critical nature of illness in these patients and the high incidence of perforation. Percutaneous cholecystostomy is indicated, particularly in high-risk patients both for diagnosis and treatment. Acute cholangitis results from a combination of bactibilia and biliary obstruction. The majority of patients can be successfully managed with intravenous antibiotics and fluid resuscitation. In those patients in whom initial management is not successful, biliary drainage, which is best accomplished nonoperatively, should be instituted. There is a very limited role for early surgical intervention in acute suppurative cholangitis. Biliary leaks resulting in bile ""peritonitis"" or bilomas are common sequelae of laparoscopic bile duct injury. Although surgeons may feel it is necessary to operate urgently, delineation of the proximal biliary anatomy via percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and biliary stent placement is the appropriate first step in management.

In addition, the value of oral cholecystography in demonstrating patency of the cystic duct was compared with ultrasound assessment of gallbladder function. Despite ""negative"" plain gallbladder radiographs in all patients, oral cholecystography showed significant stone calcification in 8 of the 91 patients and CT showed stone calcifications in 52 of the 91 patients. In 12 patients the maximum stone density was between 50 and 90 Hounsfield units, and in 40 patients it was more than 90 Hounsfield units.

Oral cholecystography showed satisfactory concentration of contrast medium in all patients, while ultrasonography of the gallbladder following a chemically defined test meal demonstrated contractility of more than 50% of initial volume in 69 patients and of less than 30% in 9 patients.

The indications for operative cholangiography include demonstration of unsuspected stones, of abnormal biliary tree anatomy, and of tumour within intrahepatic branches of the biliary tree; determination of the nature of periampullary obstruction and of the best approach for removal of stones impacted low in the common bile duct; avoidance of unnecessary choledochotomy; assistance in diagnosis of stenosing cholangitis, cholangiolytic jaundice or choledochal cyst; and to ensure, postexploration, that the duct contains no stones. These indications were evaluated in a review of the records of 151 patients who underwent biliary tract operations. Operative cholangiography was performed in 133 of these patients. The review disclosed that 5.7% of common bile duct stones were totally unsuspected and that 30% of common bile ducts suspected to be abnormal were proven to be clear of stones, so that an unnecessary choledochotomy was avoided.

Such stones are undoubtedly the result of chronic pancreatitis and stasis within the ductal system and may themselves serve to exacerbate ductal obstruction and recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. Endoscopic sphincterotomy has been used to relieve common duct obstruction secondary to biliary stones. This report suggests that sphincterotomy may also be used to approach selected patients who have pancreatic duct stones and recurrent pancreatitis. The technique involves a preliminary ERCP followed by standard endoscopic sphincterotomy with the papillatome positioned in the bile duct. A balloon catheter is then directed into the pancreatic duct orifice to extract ductal calculi. Although the main duct may be cleared, side branches are more difficult, and perhaps unnecessary, to clear. This method has provided relief of pain in a limited series of patients and may mark the beginning of a more aggressive approach to pancreatic endoscopy.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

These maneuvers may be more difficult and consequently more dangerous when there is significant inflammation as may be seen in acute cholecystitis, or in case of obesity, cirrhosis with portal hypertension, previous surgery with peritoneal adhesions, or anatomic variations of the hepatic pedicle. Pre-operative evaluation of clinical risk factors should be coupled with intra-operative caution and instrumental evaluation. The increase in frequency of iatrogenic biliary injuries can not be attributed simply to the inexperience of the surgeon or the learning curve as was initially suggested. Many injuries are due, rather, to the surgeon's failure to respect basic technical rules, long established for open cholecystectomy and which should not be modified for the laparoscopic technique. While routine cholangiography does not offer complete protection from iatrogenic ductal injuries, it is essential to visualize the biliary tract whenever a lesion of the ductal system is clearly identified or even suspected. In such cases, facility with the technique of intraoperative cholangiography and a knowledge of the radiological anatomy of the biliary tree are essential for an accurate and complete intraoperative evaluation of the biliary injury.

Sixteen patients (23%) had a positive diagnosis. A control group was also prospectively evaluated. We have determined that patients above age 50 with a permanent ileostomy are at statistically significant risk of having cholelithiasis, and their risk is greater than that of a control group matched for age and sex. Radiologists should recognize this association and carefully evaluate the gallbladder of any patient with a permanent ileostomy who has abdominal pain.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|22984002|Gallbladder agenesis with midgut malrotation.|A 28-year-old female presented with a 4 year history of intermittent right upper quadrant pain. Clinical examination and ultrasound suggested a diagnosis of cholelithiasis and the patient was eventually booked for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperatively the patient was found to have gallbladder agenesis and small bowel malrotation with the duodenojejunal flexure to right of midline. The gallbladder fossa was filled with fibrous tissue. Both gallbladder agenesis and midgut malrotation are rare congenital abnormalities. Gallbladder agenesis has a similar presentation to more common gallbladder pathologies, such as cholecystitis. This case illustrates the limitations of and our over reliance on radiological imaging. Moreover, it highlights the need to have a high index suspicion of gallbladder agenesis when ultrasound is inconclusive. Further investigations and imaging with modalities such as MRI should be used to reduce the risks associated with unnecessary surgical intervention.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The increase of the levels of serum CG varied with the patients; the highest levels were seen in patients with cirrhosis. After operation, the levels of serum CG and T3 were decreased significantly in patients without cirrhosis. There was positive correlation between serum CG and T3 (r = 0.4667, P < 0.01). It is indicated that the lowering of serum CG after operation may be related to the lowering of serum T3; the significant increase of serum CG level is useful to the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, which is more sensitive than Type B ultrasonography or routine examination of liver function.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Since 1984, the authors have used choledochoscopy in the treatment of suspected retained biliary stones in 75 patients. These procedures were performed in the radiology department with use of local anesthesia supplemented by an intravenously administered sedative and analgesic. A 15-F flexible fiberoptic choledochoscope was used. Fifty-one of the 75 patients were treated as outpatients. Treatment was successful in 74 of 75 patients; in one patient, intrahepatic stones were not completely removed. Electrohydraulic lithotripsy was used to fragment calculi in 11 patients (15%). Biopsies were performed in four patients (5%). Five minor complications occurred; three required overnight admission. Choledochoscopic-assisted removal of retained biliary calculi is a highly effective and safe procedure. Advantages over standard fluoroscopic stone removal include the ability to directly visualize and fragment adherent or impacted stones and visualize noncalculous filling defects, such as air bubbles, mucus, and biliary tumors.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|2178549|Hepatobiliary imaging: imaging modalities.|Imaging modalities are a major part of the diagnosis and follow-up to therapy of hepatobiliary disease. Changes of the liver, spleen, gallbladder and pancreas can be assessed by a variety of highly technical and evolving methods. The purpose of this paper is to review briefly some diseases of the hepatobiliary tree and pancreas and how they may be diagnosed through imaging modalities. Hepatic diseases may include those that affect the parenchyma, biliary tree, or gallbladder. The spleen is often altered in size secondary to liver disease. Pancreatic diseases present particular difficulties in diagnosis as they relate to clinical chemistry tests, tumor markers or imaging. Imaging modalities for hepatobiliary disease include x-ray studies with or without contrast, and with or without computerized tomographic enhancements. Some of the x-ray procedures are done in association with percutaneous or endoscopic retrograde approaches. Ultrasound is an excellent technique for evaluation of cholelithiasis and gives useful information for hepatic and splenic size. Radionuclide studies can be either anatomically or physiologically based. Magnetic resonance imaging is evolving as a very useful, specific and sensitive method of evaluating the liver, gallbladder, spleen and pancreas. There is a diverse armamentarium of imaging modalities available for the evaluation of hepatobiliary disease. Ultrasound is the first choice for cholelithiasis. Endoscopic retrograde cholecystography (ERCP) is a definitive method for evaluating the biliary tree. Radionuclide studies with the iminodiacetic acid (IDA) derivatives are very useful for functional disorders of the gallbladder. Computer assisted tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide optimal anatomic resolution for tumors, abscesses, and other metastatic lesions involving the liver and spleen.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Apart from mild fleabite-like petechiae at the side of shock wave transmission no other side effects were observed for a total of 51 procedures. We believe electromagnetically generated shock waves are safe, easy to apply, and relatively effective in the therapy of common bile duct and intrahepatic stones.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones
CD010339|1855767|Biliary acute pancreatitis.|Severe biliary acute pancreatitis is frequently associated with persisting bile duct stones, which has important implications with regard to management. In mild cases, cholecystectomy with operative cholangiography during the same admission is the treatment of choice. In patients with a severe attack, however, management remains controversial. There is increasing evidence to suggest that early biliary decompression with endoscopic sphincterotomy is associated with a lower morbidity and mortality than a conservative regime. In certain situations endoscopic sphincterotomy may also obviate the need to explore the common bile duct, and in high-risk patients may allow surgery to be avoided altogether.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Twelve patients (8 men, 4 women--mean age 43 years) treated with continuous subcutaneous octreotide infusion for acromegaly (mean duration 26.5 months, mean dose 541 micrograms/day) were included. Bile collection by duodenal intubation was performed before, during, and 45 days after octreotide treatment in 3, 12, and 8 patients, respectively. Abdominal ultrasonography and/or oral cholecystrography were also performed before (n = 9 patients), during (n = 12), and after treatment (n = 10). Bile examination was normal in the 3 patients controlled before treatment but showed that 58.3 percent of the treated patients had cholesterol monohydrate crystals. After discontinuation of octreotide only 25 percent of patients had cholesterol crystals. In 3 patients (25 percent) treated longer than 6 months, cholesterol crystals occurred prior to the occurrence of small radiolucent gallstones: one patient underwent cholecystectomy because of biliary colic, while in the two others, complete dissolution of stones was obtained after 10 months of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid given in association with octreotide. None of the 9 other acromegalic patients (including 7 treated more than 20 months) developed stones. Cholesterol gallstone formation seems to be increased in acromegalic patients during long-term octreotide treatment but the exact incidence remains to be determined in larger series of patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

In 3 patients (25 percent) treated longer than 6 months, cholesterol crystals occurred prior to the occurrence of small radiolucent gallstones: one patient underwent cholecystectomy because of biliary colic, while in the two others, complete dissolution of stones was obtained after 10 months of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid given in association with octreotide. None of the 9 other acromegalic patients (including 7 treated more than 20 months) developed stones. Cholesterol gallstone formation seems to be increased in acromegalic patients during long-term octreotide treatment but the exact incidence remains to be determined in larger series of patients.|0|Ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosis of common bile duct stones
CD011549|1769469|[Effects of biliary lithogenesis in acromegalic patients with long-term octreotide (SMS 201-995) treatment].|This study was performed to evaluate the risk of gallstone formation during long-term treatment with the long-acting somatostatin analog octreotide (SMS 201-995). Twelve patients (8 men, 4 women--mean age 43 years) treated with continuous subcutaneous octreotide infusion for acromegaly (mean duration 26.5 months, mean dose 541 micrograms/day) were included. Bile collection by duodenal intubation was performed before, during, and 45 days after octreotide treatment in 3, 12, and 8 patients, respectively. Abdominal ultrasonography and/or oral cholecystrography were also performed before (n = 9 patients), during (n = 12), and after treatment (n = 10).

CD010339|2226102|Cirrhosis of the liver. A risk factor for development of cholelithiasis in males.|An ultrasonographic study about the prevalence of cholelithiasis was performed in 410 cirrhotic patients and in 414 controls matched for age and sex. Gallstone disease was found more often in cirrhotic patients (31.9%) than in controls (20.7%) (P less than 0.001). The female-to-male ratio of gallstones prevalence in cirrhotic patients approached to 1:1. Gallstone disease in cirrhotic patients vs controls was significantly higher (30.2% vs 16.5%) (P less than 0.001) in males only. No difference was found, for gallstone disease prevalence in cirrhosis of different etiology. The prevalence of cholelithiasis increased from Child's A to Child's C with a significant trend (P less than 0.001); this difference was significant in males (12.3% vs 40.5%) (P less than 0.001) but not in females. This study shows that cirrhosis represents a risk factor for the development of cholelithiasis in males. We suggest that high levels of estrogens could play a role in these patients, by an impairment of gallbladder emptying similar to that observed in pregnant women.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|8868023|Recent approach for common bile duct stone.|One hundred and thirty-nine patients underwent cholecystectomy from 1992 through 1994. Twenty-seven patients demonstrated preoperative risk factors for common bile duct (CBD) stones and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). ERCPs were successful in 25 (92.6%) patients and there were two failures, due to pyloric obstruction and duodenal diverticulum. Of 25 patients suspected of harboring CBD stones, 48 per cent had bile duct stones on preoperative ERCP. In contrast, 3 of 112 patients (2.7%) thought not to have stones indeed had choledocholithiasis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LC) were performed on 19 (76%) of 25 patients. Of these 19, 13 (68%) had negative ERCP, 5 (26.3%) had stones removed by endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES), and only one was accomplished with laparoscopic choledochoduodenostomy. Open exploration of CBD was performed on 3 patients who had complex CBD stones and bilio-enteric bypasses in 2 patients who had multiple impacted stones in the left main duct. Overall, three endoscopic failures (2 ERCPs and 1 ES) were managed by open biliary surgery. We suggest that patients with complex CBD stones who are not successful in stone extraction via ES should undergo open CBD surgery. LC following successful ES has been accepted as the gold standard for the treatment of simple CBD stones.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Thirty-seven patients with biliary disease diagnosed by surgery and direct cholangiography underwent MRI with T1-weighted images (T1-WI), T2-weighted images (T2-WI), and MRCP (source images and projection images). The rate of stone detection was evaluated for each MRI image and modality. Fifteen of 37 patients were found to have common bile duct stones at surgery. The depiction rate of T1-WI, T2-WI, source images, and projection images were 7%, 67%, 93%, and 53%, respectively. The depiction rate of MR, US, CT, direct cholangiography, and DIC were 100% (15/15), 25% (3/12), 64% (9/14), 71% (5/7), and 57% (4/7), respectively. In addition, there were two false-positive cases, one of duodenal diverticulum (Lemmel's syndrome) and the other of hemobilia.

All were subjected to laparoscopy. 2 of them were diagnosed as having persistent chronic hepatitis and the remaining patient had hepatic fibrosis. ERCP revealed alterations in the intrahepatic ducts and there was stenosis of the end of the common bile duct in one of them. The most frequent histological findings were periportal reactions with lymphocytes, plasma cells of macrophages, and periductal fibrosis with obliteration of the canaliculae.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones

CD010339|2699052|[Diagnosis of choledocholithiasis and residual lithiasis. Ultrasonic postcholecystectomy].|246 patients with proven common bile duct stones at surgery were studied in order to establish the accuracy of ultrasound scanning in detecting choledocholithiasis and to compare the sensitivity of real-time examinations with those performed by a static scanner. The detection of choledocholithiasis by real-time ultrasound was 45.6% compared to 26.3% for the examinations performed with a static scanner. A dilated common bile duct was detected in 83.6% using real-time scanning compared to 70.3% using a static scanner. When the common bile duct was not dilated ultrasound was unable to detect the stones. Real-time ultrasound detected 66.6% of the patients with residual choledocholithiasis compared to 23.5% of patients examined by a static scanner. Our results show that real-time ultrasound scanning is a very useful screening method in detecting choledocholithiasis and residual lithiasis.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|2917531|Biliary lithiasis: combined endoscopic and surgical treatment.|A combined endoscopic and surgical procedure was performed in 69 patients suffering from gallbladder lithiasis with suspected associated lithiasis of the common bile duct (CBD). The procedure was spread over two days: Day 1 - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed choledocholithiasis in 50 cases and papillary sclerosis in 4 cases. In 15 patients, the common bile duct was found to be normal. Fifty-four endoscopic sphincterotomies were performed. Among the 50 cases of choledocholithiasis, endoscopic removal of the stones was judged complete in 44 cases and incomplete in the other 6. Day 2 - Cholecystectomy was carried out in all the patients. Peroperative cholangiography confirmed the results of the pre-operative ERCP with respect to the CBD in all the patients except one, and a choledochotomy was necessary in 6 patients. Results were as follows: The average length of hospitalization was 12.4 days. No residual choledocholithiasis was noted. The morbidity of the procedure was 7.2%, and the mortality 1.4% unrelated to the technique.

CD010339|3971936|ERCP using a special catheter with external steering. A reliable aid in typical ERCP problems.|ERCP is the most sensitive procedure for opacification of the bile and pancreatic ducts. The procedure fails, however, in up to 60% of Billroth II resected patients, and in 5% of nongastrectomized patients, often owing to problems of papillary cannulation with the conventional ERC-catheter, or insufficient control in the bile duct. Therefore, we attempted to perform ERCP with a catheter provided with external steering, which can be introduced through the channel of any commercially available endoscope. This catheter permitted successful ERCP in 11 patients in whom conventional ERCP technique had failed. The endoscopic procedure with the catheter described was simple and reduced papillary cannulation problems in patients with juxtapapillary diverticulum and in those with Billroth II resection, and it permitted selective opacification of intrahepatic bile ducts or the cystic duct.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|17925730|[Precancerous lesions of the gallbladder].|This Mini-review summarizes the epidemiology, predisposing and pre-cancerous conditions related to carcinoma of the gallbladder. In 75% of cases, gallbladder cancer is a cholangiocarcinoma, usually presenting in a late and advanced stage, and it carries one of the worst prognoses of all GI malignancies. Early stage disease is usually discovered incidentally by the pathologist in a gallbladder specimen removed for calculous cholecystitis. It occurs three times more frequently in women than in men and invasive forms usually occur after the age of 60. Incidence varies with geographic location. Besides genetic and geographic factors, the presence of one or more large gallstones is a major risk factor. Gallbladder polyps larger than 1.5 cm. (especially solitary sessile hypoechogenic polyps) are associated with a 50% risk of malignancy. Choledochal cysts and other variations of the biliopancreatic junction are also associated with high risk; cancer may occur at a much younger age in these patients and in the absence of gallstones. Porcelain gallbladder is a risk factor, particularly when there is calcification of the gallbladder mucosa. Chronic gallbladder infection has been implicated as a risk factor for malignant degeneration. Finally, cancer of both the gallbladder and the bile ducts is more frequent in patients suffering from primary biliary cirrhosis.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

While a majority of reports recommend early open cholecystectomy for biliary pancreatitis the use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in this disease has not yet been discussed. We retrospectively reviewed 52 patients with biliary pancreatitis being admitted to our ward in the last five years. Cholecystectomy was performed in 48 patients. Ten had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Postoperative complications occurred in 8 of the 48 patients (16.6%). Four patients (8.3%) died due to necrotizing pancreatitis or rupture of pseudocysts. We found a correlation between morbidity and mortality and the prognostic score as well as the presence of pseudocysts. We conclude that biliary pancreatitis is a good indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with a low prognostic score. The presence of pseudocysts in our view is no contraindication for laparoscopy. Although it may increase postoperative morbidity.

According to McSherry's subclassification based on endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography we distinguish a type I, involving an external compression of the common hepatic duct by a large stone impacted in the cystic duct or Hartmann's pouch without lesion of the gallbladder or the common hepatic duct wall. In type II a cholecysto-choledochal fistula is present, caused by a calculous which has already eroded partly or completely into the common bile duct. The type I is better treated with a partial cholecystectomy, the type II with a partial cholecystectomy and a bilio-digestive anastomosis. Due to a severe inflammatory process with dense adhesions and odematous changes of the hepato-duodenal ligament, it is dangerous to prepare the Calot's triangle, in case of conventional cholecystectomy and/or in case of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. From 1986-1991 we have successfully treated 10 patients according to this concept (7 patients with type II, 3 patients with type I). We have no mortality and no lesion of the biliary system.

CD010339|9916588|Endosonography/bile drainage combination for difficult-to-diagnose gallbladder disease.|The diagnosis of cholecystitis and cholelithiasis is often straightforward, particularly when transabdominal ultrasound (TUS) reveals gallstones or other abnormalities of the gallbladder. There remain many patients, however, with typical biliary pain and normal findings on TUS. This latter group of patients, in which women constitute a large majority, often undergo considerable suffering. Their medical care can also be quite costly. Cholecystokinin cholescintigraphy and stimulated biliary drainage (SBD) have been proposed for difficult-to-diagnose gallbladder disease, but they both have limitations. Cholecystokinin cholescintigraphy may not predict postoperative outcomes with a high degree of reliability. The processing and interpretation of bile drainage specimens is not standardized, and the sensitivity of SBD is less than that of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Combined endoscopic ultrasound and stimulated biliary drainage (EUS/SBD) offers a high degree of sensitivity in the diagnosis of cholecystitis and microlithiasis. Positive EUS/SBD is also highly correlated with long-term symptom resolution or relief following cholecystectomy.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|18176982|Anatomical variations of the cystic duct: two case reports.|Anatomical variations of the cystic duct often occur and may be encountered during cholecystectomy. Knowledge of the variable anatomy of the cystic duct and cysticohepatic junction is important to avoid significant ductal injury in biliary surgery. Here, we present two unusual cases with an anomalous cystic duct, namely, low lateral insertion and narrow-winding of the cystic duct. The first case was a 64-year-old man with cholelithiasis and chronic cholecystitis. During surgery, the entrance of the cystic duct was misidentified as being short and leading into the right hepatic duct. Further exploration showed multiple calculi in the right and common hepatic ducts. Cholecystectomy was completed, followed by T-tube drainage of the common and right hepatic ducts. Postoperative T-tube cholangiography demonstrated that the two T tubes were respectively located in the cystic and common hepatic duct. Six weeks later, the retained stones in the distal choledochus were extracted by cholangioscopy through the sinus tract of the T-tube. The second case was a 41-year-old woman, in which, preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed a long cystic duct, with a narrow and curved-in lumen. The patient underwent open cholecystectomy. Both patients were cured. The authors propose that preoperative ERCP or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and intraoperative cholangiography or cholangioscopy constitute a useful and safe procedure for determining anatomical variations of the cystic duct.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|3167533|Gallbladder non-filling: an indication for cholecystectomy after endoscopic sphincterotomy.|The place of endoscopic sphincterotomy in the treatment of common duct stones leaving the gallbladder in situ remains controversial. Over a 3-year period, 20 elderly high-operative-risk patients with stones in the common duct and intact biliary tree were treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy leaving the gallbladder in situ. Two patients underwent cholecystectomy for persistent symptoms after endoscopic sphincterotomy, and 18 patients were discharged from hospital, with the gallbladder intact. Of the 18 patients, 6 developed recurrent gallbladder problems, with 3 of the 6 dying as a result of these problems. On review of our data, these six patients were in a group of eight who, at the time of original endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC), were shown to have an obstructed cystic duct. The other 10 patients, with a patent cystic duct and discharged with gallbladder in situ, remained symptom free over a median follow-up period of 9 (range 2-42) months. We conclude that if the gallbladder does not fill at ERC (indicating probable cystic duct obstruction), cholecystectomy is warranted. When the gallbladder fills, regular follow-up alone is justified in the absence of symptoms.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|3167536|Benign disease of the common bile duct.|The incidence of common bile duct (CBD) pathology in a group of patients with benign biliary disease (n = 505) was found to be 23.2 per cent. The spectrum included 111 patients (90.2 per cent) with CBD stones, 37 of whom (33.3 per cent) had no symptoms or findings pre-operatively indicating CBD involvement. Five patients had papillary stenosis, three had postoperative CBD strictures, one had a choledochal cyst and one had an external biliary fistula. Of the 100 CBDs measuring more than 10 mm in diameter, 90 harboured calculi. In the remaining 23 CBDs measuring less than 10 mm, calculi were present in 21. The presence of CBD calculi was demonstrated by intra-operative cholangiography in 49 patients. In the remaining patients (n = 74), the diagnosis of CBD pathology was made either by percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography, T-tube cholangiography or peroperative palpation. The surgical procedures performed included choledochotomy and T-tube drainage (n = 74), transduodenal sphincteroplasty (n = 27) and choledochoduodenostomy (n = 18). The overall mortality and morbidity of CBD exploration was 3.3 per cent and 24.4 per cent respectively, which was significantly greater than that for cholecystectomy alone (0.3 per cent and 8.6 per cent respectively).

The correct treatment for each of these clinical entities is different and can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from these diseases.

Because gastrointestinal imaging has lagged behind other body systems in the evaluation of digital acquisition, we investigated the potential utility of this technique for direct digital fluoroscopic spot filming of gastrointestinal examinations. In order to assess the level of clinical image quality achieved by this technique, we conducted an observer performance comparison study of digitally acquired and conventional analog 100 mm spot films. Sequentially acquired spot films and digital radiographs of 111 anatomic regions in 60 patients undergoing routine barium and cholangiographic examinations were compared. Evaluation was made of on-line interactive performance as well as side-by-side analysis of digital and analog hard copy images. Parameters evaluated include detection of normal and pathologic features, image contrast, image resolution, and image sharpness. Direct digital and analog spot films were of comparable diagnostic quality in all parameters studied. Added benefits of the digital mode included postprocessing to enhance detail in regions of low contrast and accommodation of a large field of view (14 inch) image intensifier format.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Historically, the incidence of disorders restricted to the gallbladder is low in both species; however, with routine diagnostic use of abdominal ultrasonography, the incidence of gallbladder mucoceles and cholelithiasis has increased. Extrahepatic bile duct obstruction is a well-recognized syndrome because of its association with pancreatitis and obvious jaundice.

Aim of this study was to verify the effectiveness of LC in patients presenting with acute cholecystitis on the basis of preoperative and intraoperative findings, postoperative mortality and morbidity, in order to assess those conditions which still can be considered as contraindications for LC. From September 1992 to January 1995, 133 patients have been consecutively admitted and operated for LC. 46 cases (36.5%) had histologically proven acute cholecystitis. Moreover we have compared preoperative date (clinical history, laboratory findings, Rx and ultrasound evaluation) with intraoperative findings to assess a correlation with intraoperative difficult conditions evaluated according to De Manzini score. Our results demonstrate that clinical data significantly correlate with intraoperative difficult situations. Hepatobiliary ultrasound also has shown good correlation between the thickness of gallbladder wall and difficult operations (73.9 sensibility-70.1 specificity). Therefore, in patients with clinically severe acute cholecystitis, and thickened gallbladder demonstrated by ultrasound it is very likely that the surgeon will experience difficult in intraoperative situations. In these conditions laparoscopy may be considered mainly as a diagnostic procedure in order to evaluate the entity of inflammatory changes considering the possibility of an open conversion that must be done before any iatrogenic lesion occur. This policy has allowed us to avoid in our series postoperative complications such as lesions of the biliary tree. In conclusion we believe that LC for acute cholecystitis should be considered as a therapeutical option only for selected cases.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Cold areas on an isotope scan may be due to impaired function or space-occupying lesions. The method is nonspecific and does not differentiate between cysts, abscesses and metastases. Both ultrasound and CT scanning can differentiate space-occupying lesions with a high degree of accuracy so that both techniques can be used to improve the accuracy and specificity of the radioisotope examination. CT scanning of the liver is limited by relatively slow data acquisition and the small differences in X-ray absorption within soft tissues unless contrast agents are used. In comparison, ultrasonic data are rapidly collected and displayed and liver consistency is imaged without contrast media or ionizing radiation. Diffuse abnormalities of the liver, such as cirrhosis, cannot be detected by CT scanning but are apparent on ultrasound examination. In addition, equipment purchase and maintenance costs for ultrasound are a fraction of those for CT scanning. Experience to date at Yale indicates that ultrasound and CT scanning are complementary and supplementary to isotope examination of the liver but that ultrasound in most patients produces better resolution and enhanced tissue differentiation at considerably less cost.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Diffuse abnormalities of the liver, such as cirrhosis, cannot be detected by CT scanning but are apparent on ultrasound examination. In addition, equipment purchase and maintenance costs for ultrasound are a fraction of those for CT scanning. Experience to date at Yale indicates that ultrasound and CT scanning are complementary and supplementary to isotope examination of the liver but that ultrasound in most patients produces better resolution and enhanced tissue differentiation at considerably less cost.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones
CD010339|11527174|Outcome after laparoscopic cholecystotomy and cholecystectomy in children with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis: a preliminary report.|Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCE) has become the procedure of choice for symptomatic gallstones in children. However, there is concern about the disadvantages of cholecystectomy. Numerous postoperative symptoms and a possible correlation of the procedure with a higher incidence of right-sided colon carcinoma have been described. Therefore, it has been suggested to remove the gallstones via a cholecystotomy, leaving the gallbladder in place. This is the first report on the functional and symptomatic outcome of laparoscopic cholecystotomy (LCO) versus LCE in a consecutive series of children. A follow-up study of all children who underwent surgery for symptomatic gallstone disease from 1993 to 1999 was performed. Nine underwent LCO and 8 standard LCE. The procedure was chosen according to the preference of the surgeon. Patients and parents underwent a standardized follow-up interview. The intensitiy of six gastrointestinal symptoms was graded from 0 to 3. The patients and parents scored the symptomatic outcome using a 100-point visual analogue scale. There were no intraoperative complications. Bleeding of a port site required suturing in 1 patient after LCO, and fever with a further uneventful course occurred in another after LCE. The mean duration of hospital stay was 3.0 days after LCO and 2.4 days after LCE. In 1 patient a missed gallstone was identified 4 weeks after LCO. The patient underwent LCE with a further uneventful course. At follow-up (mean 20.7 months after LCO, 28.3 months after LCE, P = n.s.) there was a tendency toward a lower incidence of symptoms after LCO. Symptoms were reported by 3 of 8 patients after LCO and 5 of 8 after LCE. The mean score of the symptomatic outcome was not statistically different. All patients with LCO were free of stones on ultrasound examination with normal contraction of the gallbladder. LCO thus represents an alternative approach. We consider LCO for children with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis before the onset of puberty. However, data on the long-term outcome from larger series are mandatory before a general recommendation can be given.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The age was 64.9 (14.2) years (mean and standard deviation), but 14 (70%) of those patients were older than 60 (range: 63 to 89) and 9 (45%) were in the 8th up to 9th decade of their lives. In 16 patients PSP was performed at the same time as cholecystectomy. Common bile duct (CBD) exploration was decided in 11 patients only on the basis of the intraoperative cholangiographic findings (evidence of CBD stones and/or benign stenosis of the Papilla of Vater) as demonstration of the permanent role of this examination in biliary surgery. Among the patients who underwent PSP some time after cholecystectomy, one had a lesion of the choledochus, sustained when he was cholecystectomized 15 days before. Because of the fact that recovery was prompt and definitely uneventful, PSP together with the infusion of somatostatin (SMTN) can be considered a useful approach to the treatment of the biliary fistula.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Standard surgical and endoscopic approaches often fail to clear calculi in these patients who have recurrent episodes of cholangitis. The success of the holmium laser for urologic calculi led us to adapt treatment strategies for primary and secondary biliary tract calculi where standard treatments had been unsuccessful. Our goals were to remove all calculi, prevent recurrent sepsis, and preserve hepatic parenchyma. Thirty-six patients with complex biliary calculi were treated. After sepsis was controlled and the extent of calculi was evaluated, appropriate access to and drainage of the biliary tract was achieved. Holmium laser lithotripsy was performed under video guidance using flexible choledochoscopes and a 200 micro laser fiber generating 0.6 to 1.0 joules at frequencies of 6 to 10 Hz. Lithotripsy procedures were repeated until cholangiography and cholangioscopy confirmed the clearance of calculi. Twenty-two patients of Asian descent with primary intrahepatic calculi and 14 patients with secondary intrahepatic calculi were treated. Access to the biliary tract could be accomplished through percutaneous catheter tracts, T-tube tracts, or the cystic duct during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Biliary drainage was by biliary enteric anastomosis or endoscopic sphincterotomy. Complete stone clearance required an average of 3.9 procedures (range 1 to 15) for patients with primary intrahepatic calculi and 2.6 procedures (range 1 to 10) for patients with secondary intrahepatic calculi regardless of stone composition. No patient required hepatic resection and no complications or deaths were attributed to the holmium laser.

The patient became symptomatic when a gallstone was trapped within the choledochocele, causing intermittent biliary obstruction. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) provided the diagnosis and endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed for definite nonoperative treatment. The lesion could not be identified on ultrasound even after its demonstration by ERC.

In recent years laparoendoscopic single site surgery (LESS) has gained greater interest and diffusion for the treatment of gallstones and also in bariatric and colonic surgery. However, no randomized controlled trials are present in the literature that confirm the clinical advantages of LESS compared with the classic laparoscopic procedures.

CD010339|3901273|Diagnosis and treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis.|PSC is a progressive chronic hepatobiliary disorder of unknown etiology for which no effective medical or surgical therapy now exists. This syndrome occurs most commonly in young men and is frequently associated with CUC. The diagnosis is best made utilizing endoscopic retrogradecopic retrograde cholangiography. Although liver histologic findings alone are infrequently diagnostic of PSC, it remains important to exclude other causes of chronic cholestasis. Although the etiology remains unknown, preliminary studies suggest that PSC is related to immunologic damage. Although viral infections can induce obliterative cholangitis in children, their role in the cause of PSC remains undefined. PSC progresses slowly from an asymptomatic stage to cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and premature death secondary to liver failure. Bile duct cancer appears to be a frequent complication of long-standing PSC. Since no therapy is of established efficacy, controlled clinical trials of both medical and surgical therapy should be encouraged. Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies commonly occur in the advanced stages of PSC, and therefore serum levels of vitamins A, D, E, and prothrombin time should be monitored on a regular basis to prevent complications associated with these deficiencies. Liver transplantation is now a therapeutic option for the treatment of end-stage PSC. Palliative surgical biliary drainage procedures, proctocolectomy, and surgical decompressive shunts that increase the risk of liver transplants, therefore, should be avoided, if possible, in young PSC patients. If a total proctocolectomy is surgically indicated, we would strongly recommend performing a ileoanal pull-through procedure, thus, avoiding the formation of an abdominal ileostoma and the risk of developing bleeding peristomal varices.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD009323|1835346|Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Experience with 375 consecutive patients.|Three hundred seventy-five consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy from September 1989 to January 1991. Three hundred forty-one (91%) presented on an elective basis, and the remaining 34 patients (9%) were admitted for acute cholecystitis (24), gallstone pancreatitis (9), and cholangitis (1). Of the 375 patients, 20 were converted to laparotomy and cholecystectomy, for an overall success rate of 95% for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Three hundred nineteen patients (90%) were discharged within 24 hours of surgery. Operative cholangiography was completed in 141 patients, showing choledocholithiasis in five (managed by postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP] in 4, common bile duct exploration [CBDE] in 1). Two retained stones (0.9%) were detected in 214 patients not undergoing cholangiography. Three patients (0.8%) were reoperated on because of perioperative complications. Overall morbidity for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 3.5%. Major complications (0.6%) included a single common hepatic duct injury and a delayed cystic duct leak at 10 days. Minor complications occurred in 11 patients (2.9%). The single perioperative death (0.3%) was due to a myocardial infarction on postoperative day 3, after an otherwise uncomplicated laparoscopic procedure. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to offer significant advantages to patient recovery, and these data suggest that it can be performed with an efficacy, morbidity rate, and mortality rate similar to those of open cholecystectomy.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

Some of the complications of the procedure, although rare, may carry significant morbidity and mortality risks. We describe the case of a 68-year-old female who underwent elective ERCP for ductal stone clearance. Immediately postprocedure, the patient developed subcutaneous emphysema and bilateral pneumothoraces. Further imaging revealed the presence of free intra-abdominal air. The patient made a very quick recovery after bilateral chest drain insertion and no further intervention was required. We propose that pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema during ERCP, in the absence of duodenal perforation may be explained by leakage of air from a site of low resistance such as the sphincterotomy site, or as a result of copious Valsalva manoeuvres performed by a patient tolerating the procedure poorly.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Since early intra-abdominal surgery has, in our experience, led to markedly increased morbidity in patients with gallstone pancreatitis, non-operative visualization of the biliary tree by percutaneous transhepatic Chiba-needle cholangiography (PTCNC) has been evaluated in 14 patients with suspected acute pancreatitis in whom life-threatening acute biliary disease could not be excluded by other nonoperative means. The final diagnosis was acute pancreatitis in nine patients (Group A) (mean serum amylase 3242 SU%) and acute biliary disease with hyperamylasemia in five patients (Group B) (mean serum amylase 2084 SU%). PTCNC made visualization of the biliary system possible in all patients and excluded the diagnosis of cystic duct or common duct obstruction in each case. Following PTCNC, potentially hazardous early laparotomy was avoided in eight of nine Group A patients. Biliary surgery was undertaken on day 3 to 13 in four Group B patients. When early laparotomy may be needed to evaluate or treat possible life-threatening acute biliary disease but is considered undesirable because of possible acute pancreatitis.

Six women and five men, aged 31-75 years, underwent percutaneous endoscopic cholecystolithotripsy between April 1988 and October 1988. The gallbladder was punctured by means of an anterior transperitoneal approach. The tract was dilated, and gallstones were removed with a modified 21-F cholecystoscope under direct visual inspection. Calculi too large for extraction were disintegrated with ultrasound or electrohydraulic lithotripsy. Eight patients were stone-free and two had small residual stones 3 months later; nine were stone-free 6 months after the procedure. Although more invasive than shock-wave lithotripsy, percutaneous endoscopic cholecystolithotripsy has the advantage of immediate removal of more calculi, causes less pain, necessitates less postoperative immobilization, and allows patients to leave the hospital sooner.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

In view of evolution of surgical sphincterotomy to sphincteroplasty, we studied feasibility of endoscopic sphincteroplasty. In 36 dogs, at laparatomy, the papilla was divided using a diathermy sphincterotome to create retroperitoneal perforation. Twelve dogs underwent approximation of the bile duct and duodenal walls with silk sutures. Another 12 dogs had the walls approximated with clips using an endoscopic clip appliance. The other 12 dogs had no approximation. Blood chemistry was obtained before and serially after surgery. Duodenobiliary barium regurgitation was determined in 2-3 weeks. Four dogs each in each group were sacrificed at 1, 2, and 4 weeks to examine the papilla macro- and microscopically. In regard to hemostasis and prevention of leakage, the effect of the clips was similar to the sutures, resulting in a wide opening with free regurgitation. The no treatment group had persistent abnormal liver function tests and amylase levels. Three dogs died on leakage with abscess and the other nine had stenosis of the papilla. These data suggest that endoscopic sphincteroplasty may be feasible using the clips. A first clinical case where the clips were used to obtain a wide opening which passed a 15-mm balloon is briefly described.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The other 12 dogs had no approximation. Blood chemistry was obtained before and serially after surgery. Duodenobiliary barium regurgitation was determined in 2-3 weeks. Four dogs each in each group were sacrificed at 1, 2, and 4 weeks to examine the papilla macro- and microscopically. In regard to hemostasis and prevention of leakage, the effect of the clips was similar to the sutures, resulting in a wide opening with free regurgitation. The no treatment group had persistent abnormal liver function tests and amylase levels. Three dogs died on leakage with abscess and the other nine had stenosis of the papilla. These data suggest that endoscopic sphincteroplasty may be feasible using the clips. A first clinical case where the clips were used to obtain a wide opening which passed a 15-mm balloon is briefly described.|0|Ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|2649405|Gallbladder function is altered in sickle hemoglobinopathy.|Despite comparable rates of hemolysis, only 50% of patients with sickle hemoglobinopathy (SH) develop pigment gallstones by age 20 yr. Thus, pathogenetic factors, other than hemolysis, may contribute to gallstone formation. In the present study we determined whether gallbladder function, measured by real-time ultrasonography or bile acid metabolism, determined by isotope dilution-mass spectrometry, were altered in adolescents and young adults with SH. Compared with healthy controls, SH subjects had larger fasting (27 +/- 16 vs. 15 +/- 5 ml, p less than 0.02), and residual (8 +/- 6 vs. 4 +/- 2 ml, p less than 0.03) volumes of the gallbladder, but similar rates of emptying (0.029 +/- 0.016 vs. 0.034 +/- 0.029 min-1) and percentage of fasting volume emptied (71% +/- 13% vs. 72% +/- 14%). In SH subjects, the volume and emptying of the gallbladder were similar between those with and without gallstones. Some SH subjects had stasis of bile within the gallbladder, as demonstrated by isotopic disequilibrium between the circulating bile acid pool and bile stored in the gallbladder. Subjects with SH with gallstones tended to have smaller bile acid pools than SH subjects without gallstones (81 +/- 11 vs 163 +/- 91 mumol/kg, p = 0.051). We conclude that adolescents and young adults with SH have enlarged gallbladders that retain an increased postprandial volume of bile. Bile retention within the gallbladder may lead to stasis and contribute to the pathogenesis of pigment gallstones.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7824881|Cystic fibrosis. Is treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid of value?|Liver and biliary diseases are common complications in cystic fibrosis (CF) and may even be so severe that liver transplantation is indicated in cases with mild pulmonary disease. The most common complications are steatosis, fibrosis/cirrhosis, micro gallbladder, cholelithiasis, and sclerosing cholangitis. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been used in the treatment of gallstones and pathological liver function in CF. The effect on gallstones has been contradictory, and the effect on liver function tests has been shown to be dose-dependent. A significantly better effect has been shown on liver function tests during treatment over 1 year with doses of 15-20 mg/kg/day. Although supplementation with taurine did not further improve this effect, it has been used in many studies. The biliary bile acid pool was enriched by UDCA from about 10% to 35-40%, but a similar increase was not seen in serum. We have studied the long-term effect of UDCA in 10 patients with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis and/or sclerosing cholangitis. Liver function and liver morphology examined on liver biopsies by both light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were followed for 2 years. Preliminary results of this study are encouraging. UDCA is an interesting drug which binds to the hepatocyte membranes, stabilizing membrane structure in in vitro experiments and increasing the bicarbonate excretion in bile in pigs. The mechanism of the effect of UDCA in CF might not only be an increased choleresis; further studies will focus on these aspects.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Endoscopic treatment is fraught with difficulty, particularly when stones are over one centimetre in diameter and the patient's coagulation is deranged. Between 1988 and 1993, 56 patients have been managed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and stent placement as the initial treatment for large CBD calculi. Complete follow up has been possible in 50 cases (89.3%). The median age was 73.5 years (range 29-92) and primary presenting symptoms were jaundice (n = 39), cholangitis (n = 6) or abdominal pain (n = 5). Median bilirubin was 99 mumol/L (range 7-926) and 60% of the patients had deranged clotting with a median thrombotest of 61%. Stones ranged in size from 0.9 to 4.5 cm (median 1.6 cm). Treatment was with a 7F 'pigtail' stent in 39 cases and a 10F straight stent in 11 patients. Morbidity occurred in 12% of cases with two deaths (4%). Stents remained in place for a median of 1 month (range 0.2-59). Definitive treatment of CBD stones, once the jaundice and sepsis had settled, involved surgery in 24 patients and repeat ERCP with sphincterotomy +/- mechanical lithotripsy in 17 cases.

In these 40 patients, long-term results during the follow-up period were as follows: free of symptoms and without evidence of recurrent stones, 22 patients (55%); free of symptoms with recurrent stones, 2 patients; recurrent stones with cholangitis, 14 patients (35%); symptoms of cholangitis without evidence of recurrent stones, 2 patients. Of those patients with recurrent stones, secondary biliary cirrhosis developed in 1, and in 9 of the patients in whom secondary cholangitis developed, subsequent laparotomy or percutaneous drainage was required. Three of the 40 patients (7.5%) died within the 4- to 10-year follow-up period. The procedural failure rate in terms of stone retention was 20.5% for patients with bile duct strictures. No stones were retained in patients without strictures. The postprocedural rate of stone recurrence for patients with bile duct strictures was 51.6%; no recurrence was seen in patients without strictures.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones
CD009323|9876678|Mirizzi syndrome type II: is laparoscopic cholecystectomy justified?|Mirizzi syndrome type II is an uncommon cause of obstructive jaundice caused by an inflammatory response to an impacted gallstone in Hartmann's pouch or the cystic duct with a resultant cholecystocholedochal fistula. Two cases of Mirizzi syndrome type II are presented. Clinically only one patient had jaundice and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) established a preoperative diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome. The other patient's diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome was made intraoperatively. It is important to properly identify the anatomy at the time of surgery to avoid compromising the common bile duct. Operative treatment of Mirizzi syndrome type II includes laparoscopic or open subtotal cholecystectomy; placement of a T-tube with either laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy; or creation of a hepaticojejunostomy with cholecystectomy. Although there is a report of laparoscopic treatment of this syndrome without long term follow-up, we believe that once there is any question of injury to the common bile duct, safety demands that the laparoscopic procedure be converted to an open one with implementation of appropriate therapy.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

CD010339|15136940|[Cholangiocellular and gallbladder carcinoma].|Risk factors for cholangiocellular and gallbladder carcinomas are bile stones and chronic inflammation of the biliary system. Gallbladder cancer and intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinomas can be diagnosed with a high sensitivity by ultrasonography, CT and MRI, while the most sensitive diagnostic methods for perihilar or distal cholangiocellular carcinomas are ERC or MRC. The only curative option for patients with gallbladder- or bile duct cancer is surgical resection. Outside clinical studies there is currently no indication for neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy. Gallbladder and bile duct carcinomas are moderately chemotherapy-sensitive tumors. The objective response rates in phase II studies with 5-FU or gemcitabine monochemotherapy are between 10 - 30 %. Higher response rates between 20 - 50 % have been observed in phase II studies with combination chemotherapy, in particular with the combination of gemcitabine/cisplatin. Because of the low incidence of gallbladder and bile duct carcinomas there are currently no large phase III trails investigating the impact of chemotherapy on survival and quality of life or comparing the activity of different chemotherapy protocols. Patients in good general physical conditions or with tumor-associated symptoms should be treated with palliative chemotherapy (whenever possible in clinical studies), while chemotherapy should be avoided in patients with severe non-tumor-associated morbidity.

One hundred thirty-seven patients were referred for endoscopic retrograde cholangiography before laparoscopic cholecystectomy for suspected choledocholithiasis due to one or more of the following abnormalities: (a) altered liver function tests, (b) increased serum amylase levels, or (c) a dilated common bile duct (> 7 mm) with or without evidence of stones on sonography. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the likelihood of the presence or absence of morbidity were calculated for 25 different variables. Common bile duct stones were detected in 63 (46%) patients. Abnormal result of sonography of the common bile duct was the best predictor of choledocholithiasis (p < 0.0001). Abnormalities of the combined liver function tests were statistically significant predictors only when combined with abnormal sonographic results. Improving liver function tests before endoscopy had a significant negative predictive value (p = 0.01). Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that abnormal ultrasound and the presence of common bile duct stones on ultrasound were significant (p = 0.009 and p = 0.049, respectively).

Eighty-five of these extractions were accomplished in one to three sessions, while eight of the patients required four to nine sessions before all of the stones were removed. Forty-five patients had multiple stones; 25, single stones; eight, sludge, fragments, mucus or debris, and no stones could be found in 12. Four patients required reoperation following unsuccessful percutaneous duct manipulation. One of these patients died along with two others who had successful extraction procedures. In two additional patients, duct obstruction recurred requiring reoperation three months and one year after manipulation. A high percentage of patients with retained biliary calculi can be successfully treated without reoperation using these methods. Failures are related to poorly placed T tubes, tortuous sinus tracts or dislodged tubes. Major morbidity and mortality are related to biliary obstruction and sepsis. An aggressive approach to infection with urgent nonoperative or operative measures to decompress completely the biliary tree is mandatory to reduce the incidence of major complications in these patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome was made 30 years earlier, whereas the anomaly of the gallbladder was manifested when the patient, at the age of 34 years, started complaining of abdominal symptoms suggestive of biliary tract disease. Diagnostic confirmation was accomplished by magnetic resonance cholangiography, thus avoiding laparotomy, whereas conventional hepatobiliary imaging studies and laparoscopy could not achieve a definite diagnosis. No other malformations were detected. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between gallbladder agenesis and Gilbert's syndrome.

With this purpose a survey was conducted sending a questionnaire to ten referencial and interventional radiology centers in the country. Seven centers answered on time. In the last five years a total of 8,736 consecutive patients were examined for cholangiography (endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, PTC). A total of 5,920 (68%) were biliary lithiasis and 53 (0.9%, range 0.5-2.6%) of these were HL. In case of HL the diagnostic procedure was the ERCP in 68% of the cases, and the PTC in the remainder 32%. The patients with HL (53% females, mean age 52, range 23-85) clinically presented cholangitis (79%); pancreatitis (6%) and five (9.4%) showed evolution to a biliary cirrhosis. Associated diseases or abnormalities of the biliary tree were: biliary postsurgical strictures (BPS), 28%; Caroli's Syndrome, 20%; and choledocholithiasis, 28%. While a 9.4% presented a ""biliary history"" (that was defined as two or more episodes of biliary surgery) and a 5.7% lacked associated or predisposing diseases. Follow-up was lost in 23% of the cases and in 77% a follow up of 38 months (range 8-60) was observed with 4.8% mortality rate. The treatment was hepatobiliary surgery in 58% of the cases; endoscopic papillotomy in 17% and combined treatments that included extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in 15%. Four out of 53 cases (7.5%) received UDCA as the only successful therapy. HL is an entity with high biliary morbidity in 85% of the cases and development in to cirrhosis in 9.4%.

Thirty-three percent of patients with gallstones had a history of symptomatic cholelithiasis which emphasizes that if elective cholecystectomy had been performed, this complication could have been avoided. Further, a large number of cases (40 percent) were found to be of the acalculous variety which suggests a possible changing trend in the pathogenesis of perforated gallbladder. Cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography and adequate drainage appears to be the procedure of choice, and aggressive operative intervention without delay is thought to contribute to the relatively low mortality of 8.6 percent in this series.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Further, a large number of cases (40 percent) were found to be of the acalculous variety which suggests a possible changing trend in the pathogenesis of perforated gallbladder. Cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography and adequate drainage appears to be the procedure of choice, and aggressive operative intervention without delay is thought to contribute to the relatively low mortality of 8.6 percent in this series.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones
CD010339|20335441|Post-cholecystectomy syndrome: spectrum of biliary findings at magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography.|Post-cholecystectomy syndrome (PCS) is defined as a complex of heterogeneous symptoms, consisting of upper abdominal pain and dyspepsia, which recur and/or persist after cholecystectomy. Nevertheless, this term is inaccurate, as it encompasses biliary and non-biliary disorders, possibly unrelated to cholecystectomy. Biliary manifestations of PCS may occur early in the post-operative period, usually because of incomplete surgery (retained calculi in the cystic duct remnant or in the common bile duct) or operative complications, such as bile duct injury and/or bile leakage. A later onset is commonly caused by inflammatory scarring strictures involving the sphincter of Oddi or the common bile duct, recurrent calculi or biliary dyskinesia. The traditional imaging approach for PCS has involved ultrasound and/or CT followed by direct cholangiography, whereas manometry of the sphincter of Oddi and biliary scintigraphy have been reserved for cases of biliary dyskinesia. Because of its capability to provide non-invasive high-quality visualisation of the biliary tract, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has been advocated as a reliable imaging tool for assessing patients with suspected PCS and for guiding management decisions. This paper illustrates the rationale for using MRCP, together with the main MRCP biliary findings and diagnostic pitfalls.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD009323|16937040|[Influence of technical advancements on the management of biliary tract diseases].|Modern cross sectional imaging methods like CT and MRCP have replaced more invasive methods for the diagnosis of cholangiolithiasis as well as benign and malignant biliary strictures. Only if a histologic or cytologic confirmation of the diagnosis is necessary, is a direct access to the biliary tract either with ERC or PTC justified as a diagnostic procedure. Due to technical advancements in laparoscopic surgery intraoperative bile duct revision has become a standard procedure for patients with choledocholithiasis discovered during cholecystectomy. It has been shown to be equally effective to ERC. In this setting ERC therefore has lost its unique claim for the treatment of bile duct stones, while it remains the treatment of choice in patients with prior cholecystectomy. In contrast ERC, sometimes in combination with PTC, has become the mainstay in the treatment of biliary lesions like leakage and benign strictures.

CD010339|1555739|A case of septum formation of the common hepatic duct combined with an anomalous hepatic duct of the caudate lobe.|A 66-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital with upper right quadrant pain and jaundice. Laboratory data indicated the presence of obstructive jaundice. A diagnosis of cholecystocholedo-cholithiasis was made by ultrasonography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed choledochal stones with septum formation in a portion of the common hepatic duct up to where an anomalous bile duct drained from the caudate lobe of the liver. We performed a cholecystectomy, T-tube drainage, and partial resection of the septum when these findings were confirmed at surgery. Histological examination of the removed septum showed fibrous stroma under atrophic mucosa. To our knowledge, this is the eighteenth reported case in Japan of septum formation of the bile duct. However, no other such case to date has been seen combined with an anomalous hepatic duct of the caudate lobe of the liver. Selective cholangiography by choledochoscope and computed tomography with a thin guide-wire inserted to the bile duct were useful in confirming the origin of the anomalous bile duct. This case may serve as further evidence of the assumption that septum formation of the common (hepatic) bile duct is a malformation of congenital origin.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD009323|7846916|Selective use of ERCP in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.|With the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCH) various strategies have been proposed for the management of common bile duct (CBD) stones. In a consecutive series of 1140 patients subjected to LCH, preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was attempted in 128 patients (11.2%) and successfully accomplished in 121 (94.5%). Based on the prediction of CBD stones by laboratory tests, ultrasonography, and intravenous cholangiography, prelaparoscopic ERCP was performed in 106 patients (9.3%). CBD stones were identified in 56 patients and benign papillary stenosis in 5 patients (57.5%). Of these 61 patients, 58 (95%) were treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) and stone extraction followed by LCH after a mean interval of 1.6 days. Three patients with failure of endoscopic ductal stone extraction required open CBD exploration. In 39 of the 106 patients (36.8%) ERCP was negative for ductal stones but revealed unexpected ampullary and pancreatic cancer in two cases. Six patients (of the 106) with preoperative ERCP cannulation failure (5.7%) were managed either by LCH and intraoperative cholangiography or by open CBD exploration. In 22 of the 1140 total patients (1.9%) ERCP was performed at various intervals after LCH. Retained CBD stones were found in eight patients, and ES and ductal clearance was achieved in all eight. There was no mortality among the entire surgical group who underwent perioperative ERCP/ES. Including two cases of ES-related pancreatitis, the overall morbidity was 5.5% (7 of 128). Perioperative ERCP/ES in conjunction with LCH is an attractive approach for patients with cholecystocholedocholithiasis, at least until laparoscopic ductal clearance becomes a standard procedure.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed a CBD stone (20 mm x 15 mm). We diagnosed her with choledocholithiasis and performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to remove the stone. However, unfortunately, the retrievable basket around the stone became impacted. An endotriptor along with forceps could not be used owing to the entrapment of the basket, and thus we performed urgent surgery. The basket containing the stone was removed through a longitudinal choledochotomy. The wires leading to the basket were cut, and the basket containing the stone was removed via the incision. A T-tube was inserted, and the choledochotomy was closed. The postoperative course was uneventful. In conclusion, if the diameter of a CBD stone is more than 20 mm, then the risk of basket impaction increases, and surgery may be necessary as the initial treatment of the CBD stone.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

One reason for this discrepancy might be that type 2 DM is often accompanied by obesity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of obesity and of type 2 DM, separately and together, as risk factors for gallstones. In all, 203 obese patients with normal glucose tolerance (obese NGT), 446 obese patients with type 2 DM (obese type 2 DM), 269 lean patients with type 2 DM (lean type 2 DM) and 250 lean subjects with a normal glucose tolerance (lean NGT) were evaluated by ultrasonography for the presence of gallstones. At univariate analysis patients with gallstones (177) were older and were more frequently affected by both obesity and type 2 DM, and had higher triglycerides and fasting blood glucose levels. At multiple logistic regression analysis, only age and obesity, both in the presence or in absence of type 2 DM, were strongly associated with gallstones (P < 0.001); diabetes alone had a lower level of statistical significance (P = 0.07). These data suggest that obesity is a stronger risk factor for gallstones than type 2 DM.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|14642857|Hepatobiliary, renal and bone complications of intestinal failure.|Abnormal liver function tests in patients with intestinal failure (IF) may be due to the underlying disease, IF or the treatments given (including parenteral nutrition (PN)). PN-related liver disease in children usually relates to intrahepatic cholestasis and in adults to steatosis. Steatosis may be consequent upon an excess of carbohydrate, lipid or protein, or upon a deficiency of a specific molecule. Pigment-type gallstones are common in adults and children with IF; these develop from biliary sludge that forms during periods of gallbladder stasis. Ileal disease/resection, parenteral nutrition, surgery, rapid weight loss and drugs all increase the risk of developing gallstones. Gallstone formation may be prevented by reducing gallbladder stasis (oral/enteral feeding or prokinetic agents), altering bile composition, or by means of a prophylactic cholecystectomy. Calcium oxalate renal stones are common in patients with a short bowel and retained functioning colon and are consequent upon increased absorption of dietary oxalate; they are prevented by a low-oxalate diet.

CD010339|14534824|Management of biliary and duodenal complications of chronic pancreatitis.|Biliary stricture and duodenal obstruction have been increasingly recognized as complications of chronic pancreatitis. The anatomical relationship of the distal common bile duct and the duodenum with the head of the pancreas is the main factor for their involvement in chronic pancreatitis. In hospitalized patients with pancreatitis, the incidence of biliary stricture and duodenal obstruction is reported to be about 6% and 1.2%, respectively. For patients requiring an operation for chronic pancreatitis the incidence increases to 35% for biliary stricture and 12% for duodenal obstruction. Fibrosis around the distal common bile duct can cause stenosis with obstruction of bile flow. Clinically, the presentation of these patients ranges from being asymptomatic with elevated alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin, or both, to being septic with cholangitis. Jaundice, cholangitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase occur more frequently in patients with pancreatitis with a biliary stricture. A twofold elevation of alkaline phosphatase is a marker of possible common duct stenosis in patients with chronic pancreatitis. The incidence of both biliary cirrhosis and cholangitis in these patients is about 10%. ERCP reveals a characteristic long, smoothly tapered stricture of the intrapancreatic common bile duct. In duodenal obstruction, the factors that convert self-limiting edema to chronic fibrosis and stricture formation are unknown, but ischemia superimposed on inflammation may be the major cause. These patients present with a prolonged history of nausea and vomiting. Barium studies typically show a long constricting lesion of the duodenum, and endoscopy reveals reactive inflammatory changes in a narrowed duodenum. Operation is indicated in patients with common bile duct strictures secondary to chronic pancreatitis when there is evidence of cholangitis, biliary cirrhosis, common duct stones, progression of stricture, elevation of alkaline phophatase and/or bilirubin for over a month, and an inability to rule out cancer. The operation of choice is either choledochoduodenostomy or choledochojejunostomy. A cholecystoenterostomy is less favored because of its higher failure rate (23%). Endoscopic stenting plays a role in patients who are unfit for surgery, but it is not recommended as definitive therapy. For duodenal obstruction, failure to resolve the obstruction with 1-2 weeks of conservative therapy is an indication for bypass. The operation of choice is a gastrojejunostomy. Not uncommonly, combined obstruction of the pancreatic duct, common bile duct, and duodenum will develop. Combined drainage procedures or resection are used to manage these problems.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones
CD011548|14534824|Management of biliary and duodenal complications of chronic pancreatitis.|Biliary stricture and duodenal obstruction have been increasingly recognized as complications of chronic pancreatitis. The anatomical relationship of the distal common bile duct and the duodenum with the head of the pancreas is the main factor for their involvement in chronic pancreatitis. In hospitalized patients with pancreatitis, the incidence of biliary stricture and duodenal obstruction is reported to be about 6% and 1.2%, respectively. For patients requiring an operation for chronic pancreatitis the incidence increases to 35% for biliary stricture and 12% for duodenal obstruction. Fibrosis around the distal common bile duct can cause stenosis with obstruction of bile flow. Clinically, the presentation of these patients ranges from being asymptomatic with elevated alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin, or both, to being septic with cholangitis. Jaundice, cholangitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase occur more frequently in patients with pancreatitis with a biliary stricture. A twofold elevation of alkaline phosphatase is a marker of possible common duct stenosis in patients with chronic pancreatitis. The incidence of both biliary cirrhosis and cholangitis in these patients is about 10%. ERCP reveals a characteristic long, smoothly tapered stricture of the intrapancreatic common bile duct. In duodenal obstruction, the factors that convert self-limiting edema to chronic fibrosis and stricture formation are unknown, but ischemia superimposed on inflammation may be the major cause.

The rate of successful laparoscopic treatment, including laparoscopy-assisted abdominal surgery, was 97.6% (83 of 85 patients). Perioperative complications occurred in only three patients (3.5%), and there were no deaths related to the operation. Thus, when patients with a nonvisualized gallbladder on DIC undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy, meticulous procedures must be carried out; however, as the rate of successful laparoscopic treatment is high, cholecystectomy under laparoscopy is feasible for experienced surgeons.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD011549|7773457|Feasibility of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for patients with a nonvisualized gallbladder on drip infusion cholangiography.|We report here the operative findings, the incidence of successful laparoscopic treatment, and the perioperative complications in patients with nonvisualized gallbladder on drip infusion cholangiography (DIC). Eighty-five patients with a nonvisualized gallbladder on DIC were entered into the study. None of the patients had a minimal adhesive gallbladder; 51 to 85 patients (60.0%) had moderate adhesive gallbladders, and 34 (40.0%) had severely adhesive ones. The rate of successful laparoscopic treatment, including laparoscopy-assisted abdominal surgery, was 97.6% (83 of 85 patients). Perioperative complications occurred in only three patients (3.5%), and there were no deaths related to the operation. Thus, when patients with a nonvisualized gallbladder on DIC undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy, meticulous procedures must be carried out; however, as the rate of successful laparoscopic treatment is high, cholecystectomy under laparoscopy is feasible for experienced surgeons.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones

Feasibility and status].|Percutaneous transhepatic access to the bile duct has opened up new possibilities not only for diagnosis by means of cholangiography and cholangioscopy with endoscopically guided biopsy by small-bore equipment, but also for the treatment of benign and malignant obstructive jaundice. In malignant disease recanalization of the obstruction is possible by means of laser, intracavitary irritation, internal bile drainage in Klatskin tumors, large-diameter endoprostheses (e.g., a Y-shaped prosthesis) or metal stents. In benign disease, balloon dilatation of inflammatory stenoses, stone extractions from the bile duct or gallbladder by means of Dormia baskets, ultrasound or piezoelectric shockwave-contact lithotripsy and chemical litholysis are possible.

The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of endoluminal occlusion of the cystic duct using a biodegradable polyglycolic acid screw and simultaneous gallbladder mucosal ablation with a Sotradecol-ethanol mixture. Eight pigs had operative cholecystotomy. A polyglycolic acid screw was twisted into the cystic duct after the proximal cystic duct mucosa was thermally ablated using electrocautery. Cholecystography confirmed occlusion of the cystic duct. Synchronous ablation of the gallbladder mucosa was then done by instilling absolute alcohol and 2% Sotradecol. The gallbladder was drained. Animals were sacrificed on days 14, 28, and 42. All animals survived operation and showed no untoward effects. Postmortem gross inspection showed gallbladders were shrunken and surrounded with adhesions from adjacent tissue. Cholangiography and cholecystography confirmed occlusion of the cystic duct in 6 of 8 pigs (75%). Histopathologic examination showed extensive areas of mucosal necrosis mixed with small areas of epithelial regeneration.

The pathologic findings in these patients were compared with those in a matched group of 58 patients without PDD, who were simultaneously undergoing a similar investigation for the same clinical presentations. Pathologic findings in the pancreas and/or biliary tree were detected in 70.7% of all patients with PDD, compared with 39.7% in the control group. In patients with PDD, pancreatobiliary anomalies were detected in all patients who presented with jaundice, 85% of patients with pancreatitis, and 27.8% of patients with abdominal pain, as compared with 60%, 40%, and 17%, respectively, in the control group. In 23 patients, ERCP findings demonstrated pancreatobiliary abnormalities that were not detected by other imaging modalities. Fifteen of the patients with PDD and pancreatobiliary anomalies had undergone cholecystectomy between six months and five years previously.

CD010339|9244096|Trends in management of gallbladder disorders in children.|Gallbladder disorders have been recognized with increasing frequency in pediatric patients. This study aimed to identify recent trends in management and compare the effectiveness of laparoscopic (LC) over open cholecystectomy (OC) by a retrospective chart analysis of all cholecystectomies from 1990 through 1995. Information obtained included demographics, symptoms, predisposing conditions, associated illnesses, family history, imaging studies, type of cholecystectomy, complications, operative time, pain medication, diet recommencement, pathologic findings, and length of hospital stay. The type of cholecystectomy (OC vs. LC) was compared with the clinical variables using standard statistics. Eighty-three patients between 21 months and 18 years of age were identified; their mean age was 14.8 years. Females (76%) with classic biliary symptoms predominated;12% of the patients developed gallstone pancreatitis and 7% jaundice. Abnormal liver chemistry values, obesity, and elevated triglyceride levels comprised the most significant predisposing factors. Indications for surgery were cholelithiasis in 71 patients (86%), gallbladder dyskinesia in 10 (12%), and sludge/polyp in 2. Fifty-nine cholecystectomies (71%) were done laparoscopically and 24 (29%) open. Choledocholithiasis in 6 children (7%) was managed by open extraction with t-tube placement or endoscopic papillotomy followed by LC. No major ductal complication was identified. The predominant pathologic finding was chronic cholecystitis, including the subgroup with biliary dyskinesia. Statistical comparison showed that LC is superior to OC in regard to length of stay, diet resumption, use of pain medication, operating time, and cosmetic results. It is concluded that a contemporary diet, obesity, and abnormal liver chemistry are the main predisposing conditions of gallbladder disease in children in this decade. Females in their teenage years with typical symptoms continue to be the most commonly affected group. Persistent biliary symptoms associated with low gallbladder ejection fractions during hepatobiliary cholecystokinin-stimulated scans can be caused by dyskinesia. The method of choice to remove the diseased gallbladder in children is LC, which is safe, efficient, and superior to the conventional method. Common duct stones can be managed by simultaneous endoscopic papillotomy. The costs of LC are reduced by employing reusable equipment and selective cholangiographic indications.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The type of cholecystectomy (OC vs. LC) was compared with the clinical variables using standard statistics. Eighty-three patients between 21 months and 18 years of age were identified; their mean age was 14.8 years. Females (76%) with classic biliary symptoms predominated;12% of the patients developed gallstone pancreatitis and 7% jaundice. Abnormal liver chemistry values, obesity, and elevated triglyceride levels comprised the most significant predisposing factors. Indications for surgery were cholelithiasis in 71 patients (86%), gallbladder dyskinesia in 10 (12%), and sludge/polyp in 2. Fifty-nine cholecystectomies (71%) were done laparoscopically and 24 (29%) open. Choledocholithiasis in 6 children (7%) was managed by open extraction with t-tube placement or endoscopic papillotomy followed by LC. No major ductal complication was identified. The predominant pathologic finding was chronic cholecystitis, including the subgroup with biliary dyskinesia. Statistical comparison showed that LC is superior to OC in regard to length of stay, diet resumption, use of pain medication, operating time, and cosmetic results. It is concluded that a contemporary diet, obesity, and abnormal liver chemistry are the main predisposing conditions of gallbladder disease in children in this decade. Females in their teenage years with typical symptoms continue to be the most commonly affected group. Persistent biliary symptoms associated with low gallbladder ejection fractions during hepatobiliary cholecystokinin-stimulated scans can be caused by dyskinesia. The method of choice to remove the diseased gallbladder in children is LC, which is safe, efficient, and superior to the conventional method. Common duct stones can be managed by simultaneous endoscopic papillotomy. The costs of LC are reduced by employing reusable equipment and selective cholangiographic indications.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones
CD010339|7285733|"Duodenoscopic sphincterotomy in the treatment of the ""sump syndrome""."|"The ""sump syndrome"" is recognized as a complication of a choledochoenterostomy (choledochoduodenostomy or choledochojejunostomy) performed for recurrent stone disease. A sump (a pit or well) develops in the distal, nonfunctioning limb of the common bile duct where lithogenic bile, gastrointestinal contents, and debris accumulate. This results in obstruction of the enterostomy stoma producing either cholangitis, pancreatitis pain, and/or cholestasis. It is thought that dysfunction of the sphincter mechanism contributes to the development of this syndrome. Filling defects in the bile duct are appreciated on gastrointestinal series when barium reflexes into the biliary tree through the patent stoma. Treatment has largely been surgical, but, more recently, the availability of ERCP has enabled the endoscopist to make a major contribution to the management of this syndrome. A nonsurgical alternative to treatment is duodenoscopic sphincterotomy which has been performed in 11 patients presenting with the sump syndrome. There have been no recurrences of stones in 10 patients while stones were found in one patient with an open sphincterotomy. In follow-ups of 3-30 months, there was satisfactory relief of symptoms in all patients. Because of these results, duodenoscopic sphincterotomy is recommended as a primary treatment modality in the sump syndrome."|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|1148961|Duodenal obstruction related to benign biliary tract disease.|Duodenal obstruction in six patients was related to biliary tract disease and previous abdominal surgery. Causes of obstruction were adhesions to the inflamed gallbladder, adhesions to the gallbladder bed after cholecystectomy, intramural hematoma after transduodenal exploration of the common bile duct and severe pancreatitis after common bile duct exploration. Measures that may possibly prevent duodenal obstruction include early recognition and treatment of cholelithiasis, positioning of omentum between duodenum and gallbladder bed after cholecystectomy, avoidance of transduodenal exploration where possible and careful duodenal closure if necessary, avoidance of forceful dilation during common bile duct exploration, and a decrease in the number of negative explorations by increased use of cystic duct cholangiography|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones
