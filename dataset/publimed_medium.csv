CD010339|3242144|Value of percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (PTCS).|Since July 1975, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) has been performed in 533 cases, and since April 1977 we have developed percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (PTCS) as a diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopical tool in 198 cases of malignant disease and 195 benign cases. After dilating the sinus tract of PTBD using a 15-Fr catheter about 2 weeks after PTBD, PTCS was carried out through the sinus tract. PTCS has diagnostic advantages: the lesion can be accurately diagnosed histologically and the extent of cancer in the biliary tract can be assessed by taking biopsy specimens before the operation. PTCS has been applied for cholangioscopic lithotripsy in 145 cases of gallstone disease. In 44 cases, the Nd-YAG laser and/or electrohydraulic shock wave has been used to break up the stones. The PTCS morbidity was 6% and mortality was 0.3%.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD009323|17347632|Endoscopic management of a large choledochocele associated with choledocholithiasis.|Choledochocele or type III choledochal cyst is a very rare lesion, defined as a cystic dilatation of the distal common bile duct protruding into the duodenal lumen. Abdominal pain, biliary disorders, and acute pancreatitis are frequently observed but malignant degeneration is rare. A 70-year-old man had a history of epigastralgia associated with abnormal liver function tests suggesting gallstones. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, intraoperative cholangiography showed a 40-mm-diameter choledochocele associated with choledocholithiasis. A transcystic drain was placed after cholecystectomy had been completed. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography confirmed the diagnosis and a 45-mm-long endoscopic sphincterotomy successfully treated both lesions as confirmed by a transcystic cholangiogram showing a thin-walled common bile duct with no residual stones. This case illustrates that the diagnosis of choledochocele remains difficult in clinical practice and confirms that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is the best available diagnostic tool. Coexistent choledocholithiasis is observed in about 20% of choledochocele. Endoscopic sphincterotomy is feasible and effectively treats both lesions even in larger choledochoceles.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

CD010339|950098|The effect of loss of gallbladder function on biliary lipid composition in subjects with cholesterol gallstones.|The effect on biliary lipid and bile acid composition was assessed during the development of gallbladder nonfunction in 5 subjects with asymptomatic cholesterol cholelithiasis. There was a significant increase in the relative proportion of bile salt but a decrease in that of cholesterol in bile after development of gallbladder nonfunction which persisted after recovery from cholecystectomy. These findings were associated with a decrease in cholesterol crystals in bile sediment and an increase in the proportion of secondary bile acids after cholangiographic evidence of gallbladder nonfunction. Percentage cholesterol saturation of bile reverted to normal after development of gallbladder nonfunction which persisted after recovery from cholecystectomy.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Recent technical refinements that allow for imaging of the entire biliary tree and pancreatic duct in 18 seconds make this examination easily performed even in critically ill patients. The clinical applications of MRCP are illustrated in a variety of scenarios that include choledocholithiasis, malignant obstruction, incomplete/failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs), postsurgical alterations of the biliary tract and gastrointestinal tract such as biliary-enteric anastomoses, intrahepatic bile duct pathology such as sclerosing cholangitis and AIDS cholangiopathy, chronic pancreatitis, congenital anomalies of the biliary tract and pancreatic duct, and gallbladder pathology.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|6185702|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Diagnosis of cholelithiasis in patients with normal gallbladder x-ray and ultrasound studies.|The combination of a normal oral cholecystogram and ultrasound study of the gallbladder is considered adequate evidence to exclude cholelithiasis as a cause of biliarylike pain. We examined 206 patients with biliarylike pain and normal findings on cholecystogram and ultrasound study of the gallbladder by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Of the 195 patients who had successful ERCP, 32 patients (group 1) had mild, transient abnormalities in liver function tests and 163 (group 2) had normal liver function test results. Small gallstones were demonstrated on ERCP examination in 25 of 32 group 1 patients and in four of 163 group 2 patients, all confirmed at surgery or endoscopic sphincterotomy. In conclusion, despite negative results on cholecystogram and ultrasound study of the gallbladder, patients with biliarylike pain and abnormal liver function test results should be evaluated further by diagnostic ERCP examination.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7729265|Choledocholithiasis in patients with normal serum liver enzymes.|Retrospective chart review of 330 patients undergoing ERCP over a two-year period yielded five patients with choledocholithiasis whose serum liver enzyme and total bilirubin levels were repeatedly normal. All were female, three were elderly, and the gallbladder was in situ in three of the five, one of whom had a large gallbladder remnant. In four patients, the common bile duct was dilated (> 10 mm), whereas none had intrahepatic duct dilatation. Four patients had a prominent ampulla, and stone size varied widely. Each patient was managed with endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction followed by cholecystectomy for the four patients with the gallbladder or its remnant in situ.

CD011548|7729265|Choledocholithiasis in patients with normal serum liver enzymes.|Retrospective chart review of 330 patients undergoing ERCP over a two-year period yielded five patients with choledocholithiasis whose serum liver enzyme and total bilirubin levels were repeatedly normal. All were female, three were elderly, and the gallbladder was in situ in three of the five, one of whom had a large gallbladder remnant. In four patients, the common bile duct was dilated (> 10 mm), whereas none had intrahepatic duct dilatation. Four patients had a prominent ampulla, and stone size varied widely. Each patient was managed with endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction followed by cholecystectomy for the four patients with the gallbladder or its remnant in situ.

CD010339|16957653|Endoscopic approach to acute pancreatitis.|This review focuses on the use of endoscopic techniques in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic disorders. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been used primarily to evaluate and treat disorders of the biliary tree. Recently, endoscopic techniques have been adapted for pancreatic sphincterotomy, stenting, stricture dilation, treatment of duct leaks, drainage of fluid collections, and stone extraction via the major and minor papillae. In patients with acute and recurrent pancreatitis, ERCP carries a higher than average risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis. This risk can be reduced with the placement of a prophylactic pancreatic stent. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) can establish the anatomy of the biliary and pancreatic ducts, identify pancreas divisum or pancreatic ductal strictures, depict bile duct stones, and demonstrate pancreatic or biliary duct dilation. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) provides a safer, less invasive, and often more sensitive measure for evaluating the pancreas and biliary tree, and allows some options for therapy. In acute and recurrent pancreatitis, EUS and MRCP can be used to establish a diagnosis; ERCP can be reserved for therapy.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|9512805|Hepatolithiasis and biliary parasites.|Hepatolithiasis, or the presence of intrahepatic stones, is prevalent in East Asia and is characterized by the finding of stones within the intrahepatic bile ducts proximal to the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts. Bile stasis and bacterial infection have been incriminated as the major aetiopathogenic factors. Clinical features include recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, multiple liver abscesses, secondary biliary cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma. The goals of management include accurate localization of pathologies, control of biliary sepsis and the elimination of stones and stasis. Ultrasonography, computed tomography and direct cholangiography complement each other in defining the stones, strictures and degree of liver damage. Non-operative biliary decompression by endoscopy and interventional radiology is effective in controlling the infection, but surgery remains the mainstay for the treatment of stones and strictures. Intra-operative ultrasound and flexible choledochoscopy, combined with percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy and intraductal lithotripsy, facilitate stone removal. Balloon dilatation and biliary stenting serve to open the bile duct strictures. The creation of a hepaticocutaneous jejunostomy after conventional surgery allows atraumatic access to the biliary system for the removal of recurrent stones. The management of biliary parasites begins with conservative measures, including analgesics and anti-helminthic therapy. In refractory cases or patients with acute cholangitis, endoscopic biliary drainage and the extraction of worms may be necessary. Improvement in sanitation plays a crucial role in the epidemiological control of these biliary diseases.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7665868|Magnetic resonance imaging for the visualization of cholesterol gallstones in hamster fed a new high sucrose lithogenic diet.|Cholesterol gallstone induction in hamster gallbladder is usually achieved by specific diets. An X-ray in vivo follow-up of cholelithiasis development in this species is impossible, since cholesterol gallstones are transparent as long as they are not calcified. Moreover, their size (0.2 to 1 mm) also prevents their detection by ultrasonography. The current study presents an in vivo cholesterol gallstone detection by magnetic resonance imaging in hamsters fed a new high sucrose diet containing a low proportion of cholesterol (0.015%) and a normal ratio of lipids (10%). The diet produced gallstones and an increase in the cholesterol saturation index in about 50% of animals after a 5-week feeding period. The visualization of gallstones by magnetic resonance imaging in anaesthetized animals required synchronization between breathing movements and image acquisition. A high magnetic field was also necessary to allow a fine image resolution, adapted to gallstone size. Two major advantages of this technique are a direct selection of lithiasic animals with a functional gallbladder (in spite of the presence of gallstones) and a possible adjustment of the treatment period of potential litholytic drugs.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

In our study, we found--with real-time ultrasound--a prevalence of gallstones of 16% in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated with HD which is similar to the prevalence in a non-uraemic control group matched for age and sex. In most of our HD patients, cholecystolithiasis was asymptomatic. HD patients with cholecystolithiasis were statistically significantly older than patients without gallstones. We found no differences in sex or duration of HD treatment in patients with and without cholecystolithiasis.

CD010339|22497643|Common bile duct stones in infancy: a medical approach.|Symptomatic choledocholithiasis in infancy is not common. It usually presents with jaundice and acholic stools and is diagnosed on abdominal ultrasonography. Favourable outcome of conservative management has been reported, but specific management guidelines are not well defined in the literature. We describe three cases using a combination of ursodeoxycholic acid and antibiotics as a treatment paradigm, which could potentially negate more invasive treatment. All three patients had ultrasonography proven choledocholithiasis with concomitant obstructive liver function test. They were treated with a combination of ursodeoxycolic acid and antibiotics. Patient 1 had an Escherichia coli urinary tract infection and was treated with oral bactrim. Intravenous amoxicillin, gentamicin and metronidazole were used for the other two patients. All three patients responded with a return to normal-coloured stools within 48 h of combination treatment. Repeat ultrasonography done within 11 days after the first study for all three patients confirmed complete resolution of choledocholithiasis. It is postulated that this improvement is as a result of a reduction in inflammation and oedema, associated with a low-grade cholangitis, following antibiotic treatment. This is coupled with improved bile flow with ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. The findings suggest the potential application of this safe, non-invasive therapeutic strategy as initial management in infants with this condition. A follow-up prospective randomised controlled trial may be an answer to prove the validity of this observation but due to the rarity of this problem, it would be a challenge to recruit sufficient number of patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

It is also held that all cholelithiasis in infancy has a predisposing factor such as hemolysis, prolonged fasting, congenital abnormality of the biliary tree, or the administration of TPN and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. In the last three years, four infants at our hospital have been found on real-time ultrasonography to have gallstones. Their ages ranged from 3 weeks to 6 months. One patient had a hemolytic disease but the finding of cholelithiasis in the other three patients was incidental. A repeat sonogram in the infant with hemolysis three months after initial recognition and one day before scheduled cholecystectomy revealed spontaneous resolution of the gallstones. This led us to a conservative approach in the other three patients.

The exact location of the bile leak was revealed by ERCP in 13 cases (87%): cystic duct remnant in 6 (39%), intrahepatic biliary tree in 4 (26%), and main bile duct in 3 (20%). In all cases a distal obstacle (ie: retained stones, hydatid material) to bile flow was also found in ERCP. Treatment consisted of endoscopic sphincterotomy and subsequent removal of the distal obstacle, and could be completed in 13 (87%) cases. In our experience the treatment of postoperative biliary fistula with a distal obstruction bile flow by endoscopic sphincterotomy is a safe and effective procedure, and should be recommended as the first option in those patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD009323|7866610|Common bile duct exploration: the place of laparoscopic choledochotomy.|Since laparoscopic cholecystectomy was introduced, the treatment of choledocholithiasis has been modified. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been performed selectively in elderly patients and in those with a strong suspicion of biliary duct stones (jaundice, demonstrated at ultrasound). Intraoperative discovery of common duct stones at cystic duct cholangiography signifies that they must be removed intraoperatively [or postoperatively by ERPC and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES)]. As ES has a failure rate of 3-23%, laparoscopic common duct exploration emerges as the treatment of choice. Since November 1990, we have performed 59 laparoscopic common bile duct explorations. In our experience, the transcystic technique (18 patients) with choledochoscopy appears easier to perform than with fluoroscopy without choledochoscopy. Since, during our early experience, we encountered some difficulty with the transcystic technique, we elected to evaluate common duct exploration through a choledochotomy (41 patients). The main advantage of this technique is that it provides complete access to the ductal system without damage to the papilla. This procedure seems more difficult to perform than the transcystic technique and can be used when there are contraindications to the latter.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

CD010339|16382450|Balloon dilatation vs. balloon dilatation plus bile duct endoprostheses for treatment of anastomotic biliary strictures after liver transplantation.|Biliary strictures after liver transplantation are a therapeutic challenge for endoscopy. Anastomotic strictures occur in 10% of patients after liver transplantation, leading untreated to mortality and ultimately to graft failure. Despite of successful reports, to date, there is no defined endoscopic therapy regimen for these cases. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the most suitable concept for endoscopic treatment of post-liver transplant anastomotic strictures (PTAS). A total of 72 patients post-liver transplantation, who received endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) as a consequence of suspected biliary complications were retrospectively screened for the presence of PTAS. In all patients graft rejection or bile duct ischemia were excluded prior to ERC by liver biopsy or Doppler ultrasound respectively. We compared either balloon dilatation (BD) alone or dilatation plus placement of an increasing number of bile duct endoprostheses (BD + endoprostheses) in a retrospective analysis. A total of 25 of 75 patients showed PTAS. Overall, endoscopic therapy was successful in 22 of 25 patients (88%). BD was initially successful in 89% but showed recurrence in 62%. BD + endoprostheses was initially successful in 87%, and recurrence was observed only in 31%. All recurrences were successfully retreated by BD + endoprostheses. During 22 of 109 (20%) treatment sessions stone extraction was necessary. Complication rate was low with bacterial cholangitis in 8 of 109 (7.3%) sessions, mild pancreatitis in 10 of 109 (9%) sessions and minor bleeding in 2 of 25 (8%) sphincterotomies. Median follow-up after conclusion of endoscopic therapy is 6 months (range 1-43). In conclusion, our data confirm that endoscopic therapy of PTAS is highly effective and safe. As primarily successful BD shows a high rate of recurrence, we recommend a combination of BD followed by an increasing number and diameter of endoprostheses. Therapy sessions are effective at short intervals of every 2-3 months.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

This study was designed to evaluate: 1) the effectiveness of a recently available lithotripter (EDAP LT 01) for gallstone fragmentation; 2) adverse tissue reactions after treatment; 3) the optimum conditions for use of this apparatus in man. A human cholesterol stone was surgically implanted into the gallbladder of ten 20-25 kg mongrel dogs. One dog was used as a control. The other nine animals were divided into three groups (A, B and C). Two 60 min sessions of lithotripsy were carried out twice a week. Sonographic and CT examinations were performed 9 and 16 days after operation. The animals were killed 21 days after operation. Satisfactory fragmentation was obtained in 4 of the 9 animals, and in 2 dogs no stone fragments were detected. Fragments were found in the common bile duct in 5 dogs. In 2 animals a pathologic aspect of the papilla of Vater was observed. Marked hematoma was observed in the animals treated at 5 and 10 pulses/sec. In 5 cases, hematoma was observed in the gallbladder and in one case the gallbladder was ruptured. Hematoma was also noted in the hepatic vascular bed in 3 animals. Except for microscopic hemorrhagic lesions observed at the base of the right lung, no lesions were detected in any other organ. Shock waves produced by the EDAP LT 01 are effective for fragmentation of gallstones. However, in view of the tissue reactions observed at the higher pulse rates, the pulse rate should not exceed 2.5 pulses/s for use in man.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

A human cholesterol stone was surgically implanted into the gallbladder of ten 20-25 kg mongrel dogs. One dog was used as a control. The other nine animals were divided into three groups (A, B and C). Two 60 min sessions of lithotripsy were carried out twice a week. Sonographic and CT examinations were performed 9 and 16 days after operation. The animals were killed 21 days after operation. Satisfactory fragmentation was obtained in 4 of the 9 animals, and in 2 dogs no stone fragments were detected. Fragments were found in the common bile duct in 5 dogs. In 2 animals a pathologic aspect of the papilla of Vater was observed. Marked hematoma was observed in the animals treated at 5 and 10 pulses/sec. In 5 cases, hematoma was observed in the gallbladder and in one case the gallbladder was ruptured. Hematoma was also noted in the hepatic vascular bed in 3 animals. Except for microscopic hemorrhagic lesions observed at the base of the right lung, no lesions were detected in any other organ. Shock waves produced by the EDAP LT 01 are effective for fragmentation of gallstones. However, in view of the tissue reactions observed at the higher pulse rates, the pulse rate should not exceed 2.5 pulses/s for use in man.|0|Ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

As a route for the choledochoscopy, a T-tube tract, external cholecystostomy, or jejunal limb of hepaticojejunostomy was used in nine patients, while percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage followed by dilatation of the track was established in 31 patients. The largest cholesterol stone measured 55 mm by 33 mm and the largest bilirubinate stone measured 52 mm by 37 mm. The stones were disintegrated in all but one patient in whom choledochoscopic access to a gallstone was difficult due to deformity of the gallbladder. Complete removal of the stones was achieved in 38 of 39 patients. In a patient with hepatolithiasis, small stones located deep in inaccessible branches of the intrahepatic duct remained unremovable. There were no serious complication. Minor complications occurred, including bleeding from the bile duct mucosa in four patients and postprocedure chills and fever in three.

CD010339|758694|Cholelithiasis following subtotal gastric resection with truncal vagotomy.|Subtotal gastrectomy with bilateral truncal vagotomy is a good operation for peptic ulcer disease. Recurrence rates are low, and diarrhea and dumping are usually tolerable. The development of gallstones following this procedure, however, has become more problematic in that further opeation becomes a real necessity. In two groups of patients having undergone a standardized subtotal gastrectomy, with and without truncal vagotomy, only 6 per cent of the patients with resection alone had biliary calculi develop. This is consistent with the incidence of gallstone formation in the normal population. However, in the group undergoing resection with bilateral vagotomy, 21 per cent had gallstones develop which were detected by ultrasonography or oral cholecystography and confirmed at operation. This suggests that cholelithiasis following truncal vagotomy is a long term complication which must be recognized and, unless otherwise indicated, requires an additional surgical procedure. Only when results of long term follow-up studies verify the therapeutic effectiveness of such operations as highly selective or parietal cell vagotomy without drainage will a more physiologically sound operation be within our grasp.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

However, several complications associated with spillage of gallstones have been reported recently. Most of these complications presented late after the original procedure, many with clinical pictures not related to biliary etiology, confounding and delaying adequate management. For patients presenting with intraabdominal or thoracic abscesses of unknown etiology, if there is a history of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, regardless of the time interval, certain evaluations should be considered. A sonogram and a CT scan are advisable to detect retained extraluminal gallstones, as most patients will require, not only drainage of fluid collections, but also removal of the stones. A case is described of a patient who presented with a right empyema and transdiaphragmatic abscess 18 months after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

CD010339|2757504|Biliary lithotripsy. Determination of stone fragmentation success and potential tissue injury in swine.|Application of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy to gallbladder stones was studied in 37 adult female swine. Twenty-two sows underwent cholecystostomy with implantation of human gallstones. In 20 animals, after a 10-day recovery period, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, 2000 shocks (an amount determined in preliminary water bath studies to be effective), was performed. In 10 of these implanted swine, frequent focal point refocusing and biplanar ultrasonography were employed. Two animals served as operative controls. Fifteen other animals without gallstone implantation were studied for adverse effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy on tissue. These animals (unimplanted) received 5000 shocks; 7 animals were killed 1 to 4 days after treatment and the others were killed after 4 weeks. Biochemical tests (total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lipase, amylase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase determinations) were performed on all animals at entry and every second or third day until they were killed. Successful fragmentation, defined as all residual gallstone fragments being less than or equal to 4 mm in greatest dimension, was achieved in 14 of 20 animals overall, but in 10 of 10 animals in which focal point refocusing had been used. Slight perivascular hemorrhage and minimal coagulation necrosis were seen histologically only in the liver parenchyma adjacent to the gallbladder bed. The remainder of the liver was grossly and histologically normal. No injuries to the colon, duodenum, common bile duct, or pancreas were observed. No alterations suggesting injury or altered function occurred in any of the biochemical tests.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|3377328|Biliary stone extraction.|This report summarizes a 14-year experience with 219 patients referred for sinus tract extraction of retained common duct stones. The patients ranged from 18 to 94 years of age and 60 per cent were women. Forty seven per cent of patients were seen within 6 weeks postoperatively and 79 per cent within 3 months of surgery. Sixty four per cent of patients had a single stone; the remainder had multiple stones, sludge or ductal debris. Sinus tract manipulation under fluoroscopic control was done using a variety of baskets, catheters and instruments, including endoscopy, along with pre- and post-manipulation intravenous antibiotics. Routine testing and cultures are done and useful when clinical biliary sepsis occurs (1%). Meticulous postextraction cholangiography has contributed to our success and is an important part of the procedure, usually done 24 hours after the last manipulation. Successful extraction occurred during a single session in 125 of 219 patients (57%); 60 of 219 patients required two extraction sessions. Four patients spontaneously passed stones. The remaining patients required three to seven sessions before the extraction was considered complete. Successful extraction of all stones and debris from patients' biliary ducts occurred in 210 of 219 cases (96%). Five of the nine failures occurred in the first one hundred patients (1974-1979) and all required reoperation. Failure occurred in four of the last one hundred patients (1979-1986) and all were successfully treated by ERCP extraction. Two deaths occurred very early in our series and were related to advanced biliary sepsis at the time of the initial presentation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|2818337|Treatment of postcholedochoduodenostomy symptoms.|Upper abdominal symptoms after side-to-side choledochoduodenostomy (CDDY) may be attributed to stagnant bile, food and calculi pooling in the distal bile duct 'sump' with resultant biliary or pancreatic duct obstruction and sepsis. Endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) provides a means of draining this sump. The aim of this study was to assess outcome following endoscopic retrograde choledochopancreatography (ERCP) and ES in patients with post-CDDY symptoms. Eight such patients (M: F = 1:7) underwent ERCP between September 1981 and March 1987. Their median age was 60 years (range: 37-72 years) and the median period since CDDY was 11 years (range: 1-28 years). The median follow-up after ERCP was 18 months (range: 14-94 months). Presenting symptoms comprised postprandial (one) or intermittent (seven) abdominal pain, cholangitis (three), pancreatitis (one) and jaundice (one). ERCP revealed bile duct abnormalities in four, consisting of filling defects alone (two), anastomotic narrowing with filling defects (one) and sclerosing cholangitis. ES was performed in seven, of whom three (all with filling defects at ERCP) remain asymptomatic and three are significantly improved. One had recurrent pancreatitis for which a sphincteroplasty and pancreatic duct septectomy was performed. ES was not performed in one because of technical difficulties (there being no subsequent improvement). It is concluded that, in patients with post-CDDY biliary symptoms, endoscopic sphincterotomy relieves the symptoms by either producing drainage of the sump at the distal bile duct, or dividing a dysfunctioning sphincter of Oddi.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|12640158|Papillary neoplasms of the bile duct that mimic biliary stone disease.|Papillary tumors of the bile duct are intraductal tumors with innumerable minute, frondlike papillary projections. These tumors may be either fixed to or detached from the bile duct wall. However, because the papillary projections on the surface of papillary tumors are long and slender, the tumors are friable and slough easily. The sloughed tumor fragments may float within the bile ducts, resulting in intermittent partial biliary obstruction and mimicking bile duct stones at clinical examination and at ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and cholangiography. A tumor manifests radiologically as thickening and irregularity of the bile duct wall or as a fixed or sloughed intraductal mass. A nonshadowing intraductal echogenic cast seen at US, an intraductal noncalcified soft-tissue mass with asymmetric wall thickening seen at CT, and an intraductal mass with a papillary surface and a serrated bile duct margin seen at cholangiography are all appearances that suggest a papillary tumor and may be helpful in differentiating a tumor from a bile duct stone.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

About 10-20% of patients with gallbladder stones may also present associated common bile duct stones. The management of the latter remains controversial because many different surgical strategies are available: laparoscopic treatment (laparoscopic common bile duct exploration), sequential endoscopic and laparoscopic treatment (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography/endoscopic sphincterotomy [ERCP/ES] prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy), inverted sequential endoscopic-laparoscopic treatment (laparoscopic cholecystectomy followed by ERCP/ES), and combined endoscopic-laparoscopic treatment (laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative ERCP/ES). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential endoscopic-laparoscopic treatment in patients with cholecystocholedocholithiasis. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical, biochemical and radiological features of 552 patients operated on for cholelithiasis from 1991 to 2001. Common bile duct stones were suspected on the basis of increased serum levels of bilirubin, GOT, GPT, GGT, alkaline phosphatase; presence of jaundice; history of pancreatitis or cholangitis; dilated common bile duct (diameter > 8 mm) or common bile duct stones at hepatobiliary ultrasonography; presence of common bile duct stones at MR-cholangiography or at i.v. cholangiography. In patients with suspected common bile duct stones, preoperative ERCP was performed; if common bile duct stones were confirmed, ES was performed. When common bile duct stones were not suspected preoperatively, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed directly. Overall morbidity, mortality and conversion rates in the two groups were evaluated. Of 552 patients admitted for cholelithiasis, 62 (11.3%) underwent preoperative ERCP for suspected common bile duct stones. In 41 patients (66.1%) common bile duct stones were identified and ES with common bile duct stone extraction was performed in 40 patients (clearance: 97.5%). The overall morbidity was 16% (10 cases of post-ERCP acute pancreatitis); no mortality occurred. The conversion rate during subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 4.8%. In the group of patients with no suspicion of common bile duct stones, the conversion rate was 4.9%. Sequential treatment cannot be considered the best approach for patients with cholecystocholedocholithiasis because of its morbidity rate and the high rate of negative preoperative ERCP findings. Combined endoscopic-laparoscopic treatment seems to present more advantages, especially in term of morbidity, hospital stay and patient compliance and may, in future, be considered the treatment of choice for patients with cholecystocholedocholithiasis.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

He attributed his weight loss to poor appetite due to persistent nausea. He had no significant past medical history apart from moderate mitral regurgitation and recent cholecystectomy. He felt some of these symptoms began after laparoscopic cholecystectomy 12 months before. The procedure had been complicated by a self-limiting biliary leak. He had been recently evaluated by chest physicians and gastroenterologists for clubbing and weight loss.

CD010339|10022655|An extrahepatic bile duct metastasis from a gallbladder cancer mimicking Mirizzi's syndrome.|We report a case of an extrahepatic bile duct metastasis from a gallbladder cancer that mimicked Mirizzi's syndrome on cholangiography. A 67-yr-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis. As obstructive jaundice developed after the admission, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was performed to ameliorate the jaundice and to evaluate the biliary system. Tube cholangiography revealed bile duct obstruction at the hepatic hilus, and extrinsic compression of the lateral aspect of the common hepatic duct, with nonvisualization of the gallbladder. No impacted cystic duct stone was visualized on CT or ultrasonography. Laparotomy revealed a gallbladder tumor as well as an extrahepatic bile duct tumor. We diagnosed that the latter was a metastasis from the gallbladder cancer, based on the histopathological features. This case is unique in that the extrahepatic bile duct metastasis obstructed both the common hepatic duct and the cystic duct, giving the appearance of Mirizzi's syndrome on cholangiography. Metastatic bile duct tumors that mimic Mirizzi's syndrome have not been previously reported. The presence of this condition should be suspected in patients with the cholangiographic features of Mirizzi's syndrome, when the CT or ultrasonographic findings fail to demonstrate an impacted cystic duct stone.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|6745615|Intermittency of cholesterol crystals in duodenal bile from gallstone patients.|The detection of cholesterol crystals in duodenal bile is of clinical value in the diagnosis of cholesterol gallstone disease; however, not all patients with cholesterol gallstones have crystals detected in their duodenal bile, thus limiting the value of examination of duodenal bile. The aims of this study were to (i) determine whether the lack of crystals in some patients with cholesterol gallstones was due to (a) the intermittent presence of crystals, (b) spontaneous crystal dissolution, or (c) changes in dietary cholesterol intake; (ii) determine whether incubation of duodenal bile for 24 h would result in crystal formation. Sixteen patients with radiolucent gallstones each underwent three duodenal biliary drainages. Thirty-one percent of patients had crystals in all three bile specimens, 12% in two specimens, 25% in one specimen, and 32% in no specimen. One of 31 specimens with small numbers of crystals initially had no crystals at 24 h, and five specimens initially devoid of crystals developed crystals by 24 h. Despite a significant increase in biliary cholesterol saturation index with increasing cholesterol intake, the prevalence of crystals in bile did not increase in gallstone patients. No crystals were identified in 18 specimens from normal subjects examined initially or in the 15 specimens that were examined after 24 h. We conclude that the intermittent presence of cholesterol crystals in duodenal bile is probably not due to dissolution of crystals or varying dietary cholesterol intake and that the frequency with which crystals are found increases with incubation. Determination of the diagnostic value of multiple duodenal biliary drainages or incubation of bile in patients with normal oral cholecystograms or gallbladder ultrasonograms, however, will require examinations of large numbers of patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The results showed that during 1985-1986 the sensitivity of ultrasonography (US) to detect stones in gallbladder (GB), extrahepatic bile duct (EHD) and intrahepatic bile duct (IHD) was 98.4%, 68.2% and 82.4% respectively, each was much higher than its counterpart during the periods 1981-1982 and 1983-1984 (P less than 0.01). The specificity of US in detecting GB, EHD and IHD stones was all over 90% during the latter two years. The observations made in the present study suggest that the accuracy of US has risen so significantly that it should be used as the first modality in diagnosing cholelithiasis, particularly cholecystolithiasis.

The results showed that during 1985-1986 the sensitivity of ultrasonography (US) to detect stones in gallbladder (GB), extrahepatic bile duct (EHD) and intrahepatic bile duct (IHD) was 98.4%, 68.2% and 82.4% respectively, each was much higher than its counterpart during the periods 1981-1982 and 1983-1984 (P less than 0.01). The specificity of US in detecting GB, EHD and IHD stones was all over 90% during the latter two years. The observations made in the present study suggest that the accuracy of US has risen so significantly that it should be used as the first modality in diagnosing cholelithiasis, particularly cholecystolithiasis. It, however, should be supplemented with such tests as oral cholecystography, intravenous cholangiography, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to establish a correct diagnosis when its interpretation is equivocal.|1|Ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Sixteen mongrel dogs had laparotomy and ligation of distal CBD; 1 week to 10 days later, 0-3 gallstones of varying sizes (2-5 mm) were introduced into the dilated CBD (6-16 mm). High-resolution intraoperative ultrasonography of the CBD and a conventional intraoperative cholangiogram were performed to detect the presence and number of stones. The results of these two tests were evaluated independently by two ultrasonographers and two surgeons. There were 21 true-positive and five false-negative readings by sonogram compared with 17 and 9, respectively, by cholangiogram. Sensitivity of the sonogram was 81% and 65.4% by cholangiogram. Score of accuracy was 1.06 and 1.62 by cholangiogram and 0.81 and 0.87 by ultrasound (p less than 0.05).

The accuracy of HIDA was 92% in acute and 78% in chronic cholecystitis. Intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) done in 173 patients indicated the need for exploratory choledochotomy in 24; 21 had choledocholithiasis. These observations suggest that OCG and US are very accurate, but not infallible, in detecting cholelithiasis. US should be done first; when doubt persists, the addition of OCG allows the preoperative diagnosis of gallstones in 97% of the cases. HIDA is highly accurate but not infallible in detecting acute calculous cholecystitis.

A convenience sample of patients with suspected gallbladder disease received a focused RUQ ultrasound by an EP. Sonographic findings, number of previous RUQ ultrasounds performed, and time for examination completion were recorded. Each patient then had a formal RUQ ultrasound by a sonographer blinded to the focused RUQ ultrasound results. Focused RUQ and formal ultrasound findings were compared, with the exception of the sonographic Murphy sign, which was compared to pathology reports. One hundred nine patients were enrolled. Fifty-one had gallstones. Forty-nine were detected by EPs, yielding a sensitivity of 96% [95% confidence interval (CI).87-.99]. Of the 58 patients without gallstones, 51 were correctly diagnosed by EPs (specificity = 88%, 95% CI.77-.95). The sonographic Murphy sign was present during 54 emergency examinations, but in only 24 formal studies. When compared to pathology reports, the emergency sonographic Murphy sign had a sensitivity of 75% compared to the formal ultrasound sensitivity of 45% for acute cholecystitis. EPs were less accurate for other sonographic findings, and level of experience had little effect on sensitivity or specificity for detecting gallstones.

CD010339|2634700|Gall bladder disease: an analytical report of 250 cases.|Two hundred and fifty cases of biliary tract disease were studied as regards case history, physical and laboratory investigations, surgery and follow-up. It was found that females especially multipara were frequently affected; majority of cases were in 3rd to 5th decade of their life, rise in age showing decline in incidence. Majority of cases (82.4%) were vegetarians and had used vegetable fats (oriental diet). Most of the cases (98.8%) belonged to middle and poor class and were lean and thin. Pain in the right upper quadrant of the anterior abdominal wall had been the commonest symptom, in about half the cases it got aggravated by fatty meals. A mass was felt in the right hypochondrium in 29.6% and Murphy's sign was positive in 55.5% of cases. Radio-opaque calculi were present in 8% of cases, in another 10.8% the calculi were demonstrated by oral cholecystography, radiography could detect calculi in 47 (25.4%) cases and its overall diagnostic success rate has been low (56.8%). Ultrasonography proved more valuable tool for diagnosis; bile culture was positive in 8.8% of cases only for Esch coli, proteus, klebsiella, staphylococci or paracolon. Right subcostal incision gave the best results. Chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis (74%) was more common than acalculus cholecystitis (26%), incidence of carcinoma was 2.8%, and in 5 out of 7 cases malignancy was associated with cholelithiasis. Early diagnosis and cholecystectomy for gallstones can prevent malignancy. Surgery on the whole proved beneficial and it can be more rewarding if pre-operatively other causes of dyspepsia are either excluded or confirmed. Excluding cases of malignancy, the mortality has been quite low and thus acceptable.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

A mass was felt in the right hypochondrium in 29.6% and Murphy's sign was positive in 55.5% of cases. Radio-opaque calculi were present in 8% of cases, in another 10.8% the calculi were demonstrated by oral cholecystography, radiography could detect calculi in 47 (25.4%) cases and its overall diagnostic success rate has been low (56.8%). Ultrasonography proved more valuable tool for diagnosis; bile culture was positive in 8.8% of cases only for Esch coli, proteus, klebsiella, staphylococci or paracolon. Right subcostal incision gave the best results. Chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis (74%) was more common than acalculus cholecystitis (26%), incidence of carcinoma was 2.8%, and in 5 out of 7 cases malignancy was associated with cholelithiasis. Early diagnosis and cholecystectomy for gallstones can prevent malignancy. Surgery on the whole proved beneficial and it can be more rewarding if pre-operatively other causes of dyspepsia are either excluded or confirmed. Excluding cases of malignancy, the mortality has been quite low and thus acceptable.|0|Ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|10672405|Haemorrhage into non-functioning adrenal cysts--report of two cases and review of the literature.|Adrenal cysts are a rare condition and are usually non-functioning and asymptomatic. Most of the reported cases were incidental findings or discovered at autopsy. However, large cysts have a tendency to develop complications such as intracystic haemorrhage and rupture, which can present as an acute surgical emergency. We report two cases of adrenal cysts with intracystic haemorrhage. One patient presented with persistent non-specific upper abdominal pain, investigations with ultrasound (US) scan and computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a left adrenal cyst and gallstones. Simultaneous cholecystectomy and adrenalectomy was performed with resultant relief of symptoms. The second patient presented with acute abdominal pain simulating acute surgical abdomen. Preoperative CT scan showed a large cystic lesion in the region of the tail of the pancreas with radiological evidence of haemorrhage but was unable to confirm its origin. The cyst was found to have arisen from the left adrenal gland at laparotomy; left adrenalectomy with complete excision of the cyst was done. Histology showed pseudocyst with haemorrhage in both cases. Pseudocyst is the commonest histological type encountered clinically. We believe the second case is related to pregnancy and childbirth as the patient presented during puerperium and the cyst, even though very large in size (25 x 15 x 15 cm), was not noted during antenatal screening with US scan.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Plain abdominal X-ray performed on emergency showed marked small bowel distention, and air-fluid levels suggestive of intestinal obstruction. CT was indicated to establish its precise site and cause. The presence of a gallstone was evidenced: gallstone ileus was diagnosed. Interestingly enough, at surgery the gallstone was not found; most likely it was expelled spontaneuously during the time elapsed between CT and surgery.

CD009323|7992153|Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Do preoperative factors predict the need to convert to open?|We reviewed our experience with the last 587 laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed between May 1990 and January 1993 to correlate preoperative findings that may predict the conversion of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to that of an open procedure. The prediction of a need to convert to an open cholecystectomy would allow the surgeon to discuss the higher risk of conversion with the patient and also allow for an earlier intraoperative decision to convert if difficulty was encountered. In addition to routine demographic data, ultrasound reports were available for 526 patients and the following information was recorded: presence of stones, thickened gallbladder wall, common bile duct dilatation, gallbladder sludge, and cystic duct impaction. Overall, a two times higher rate of conversion was found for male patients and patients with a body mass index > 27.2 kg/m2. Additionally, a thickened gallbladder wall on preoperative ultrasound was correlated with a six times higher conversion rate to open cholecystectomy. As expected, the positive intraoperative cholangiogram was associated with a higher incidence of conversion. Additionally, finding a dilated common bile duct on ultrasound was found to be associated with a nearly seven times higher rate of positive intraoperative cholangiogram. No statistical significance was found between conversion and age, previous abdominal operations, the presence of stones, common bile duct dilatation, gallbladder sludge, cystic duct impaction, or a distended gallbladder. Thus, these predictive findings allow the surgeon to preoperatively discuss the higher risk of conversion and allow for an earlier judgment decision to convert if intraoperative difficulty is encountered.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

CD010339|3435322|Methyl tertiary butyl ether cholelitholysis of calculi in the gallbladder and bile ducts.|Recent use of the cholelitholytic agent, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) has demonstrated its efficacy in the dissolution of cholesterol calculi. In three patients with retained stones in the bile duct, MTBE was instilled and aspirated through a T tube to effect dissolution. Stones dissolved completely in two patients, while in the third, partial dissolution permitted instrumental extraction through the T tube tract. In this third patient, dissolution of gallbladder stones in vitro was relatively slow. Patients tolerated the procedure well and there were no major complications. There was no evidence of duodenal inflammation in two patients who underwent duodenoscopy and biopsy before and after treatment. Four patients with cholesterol cholelithiasis underwent direct gallbladder perfusion with MTBE. The mean size of the gallstones was 0.8 cm (range 0.25-1.75 cm) and the mean number of stones per patient was four (range 1-13 stones). MTBE was instilled via a percutaneous gallbladder catheter inserted under local anesthesia with X-ray control. In three patients, the stone dissolution appeared to be complete after three to six hours of treatment. In the fourth patient, catheter displacement led to termination of dissolution therapy. Follow-up ultrasonograms in two patients demonstrated residual debris not visualised on the immediate post-dissolution films. Complications occurred in two patients and included catheter dislodgement and bile leakage after catheter withdrawal. Biliary perfusion with MTBE is a therapeutic option in patients with retained stones in whom instrumental retrieval has failed. It may also have a role in selected patients with symptomatic stones in the gallbladder.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|8840458|Laparoscopic choledochoduodenostomy.|Choledochoduodenostomy is less often performed since the advent of ERCP and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES). It may, however, still prove necessary in patients where ERCP and ES fail to provide long-term biliary drainage or when CBD stones recur after ES. We have performed laparoscopic choledochoduodenostomy in two patients (aged 66 and 71 years). Surgery was performed in one patient for recurrent CBD stones 25 years after cholecystectomy where three attempts at ERCP failed to cannulate the CBD. In the second patient it was performed for recurrent CBD stones 16 years after cholecystectomy and after two previous endoscopic sphincterotomies. Surgery was completed in just over 3 h in both cases and postoperative stay was 4 days. Laparoscopic choledochoduodenostomy is a viable technique which may prove valuable in the management of patients in whom ERCP and ES has failed to provide long-term biliary drainage.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7114606|Operative cholangiomanometry as a guide to common duct exploration.|A trial of operative cholangiomanometry was proposed as a guide to common duct exploration to see if this technique would help in reducing the incidence of unnecessary common bile duct explorations and the incidence of retained stones. The technique for operative cholangiomanometry as modified from White is described. This method was used in 21 patients. A very close correlation between manometry and cholangiography in predicting the presence of pathology within the common duct at the time of extrahepatic biliary surgery was shown. Flow was the most accurate diagnostic parameter. Seven patients who were found to have common duct stones had both abnormal manometry and cholangiography. Fourteen patients without stones included 12 with negative cholangiography and manometry, and two in which manometry was normal but cholangiography suggested pathology. Common duct manometry and cholangiography can be used to decrease the number of unnecessary common duct explorations and the incidence of retained stones. The theory that common duct pathology will increase pressure and decrease flow rates is supported by this study. Manometry and cholangiography should be used in combination as they are additive studies.

CD010339|10235361|Undiagnosed Mirizzi's syndrome: a word of caution for laparoscopic surgeons--a report of three cases and review of the literature.|The Mirizzi syndrome is often undiagnosed before surgery and can carry a high risk of iatrogenic damage to the common bile duct when encountered during open or, especially, laparoscopic surgery. Endoscopic management has recently been reported, but this treatment can be performed only when there is a high index of suspicion based on clinical criteria that the condition is present and therefore suggests the indication for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This is not always the case. Consequently, in a considerable percentage of patients, the syndrome is discovered only after the bile ducts have been damaged during surgery. Three cases of Mirizzi's syndrome were observed in our experience of 896 laparoscopic cholecystectomies (0.3%). All patients were without typical symptoms, and the syndrome was unsuspected in spite of preoperative intravenous cholangiography. All patients required conversion to an open procedure, with two injuries of the common bile duct (a complete transection and a tear) being promptly repaired. We conclude that when this syndrome is suspected or found during surgery, the surgeon should follow these guidelines: (1) perform intraoperative cholangiography when possible, even through the gallbladder wall; and (2) dissect the gallbladder from above and, if necessary, open it to extract the stone. Dissection of Calot's triangle should never be attempted. Great expertise is required to complete the operation laparoscopically. The reported cases in the literature refer to a high percentage of conversion, underlining the technical difficulties and making this syndrome, when undiagnosed and unsuspected, a real challenge for laparoscopic surgeons.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

A prospective study.|In a prospective trial to determine whether gastric surgery induces gallbladder sludge and stone formation, 48 patients with gastric cancer were ultrasonographically examined with simultaneous observation on changes in gallbladder contractile function before and serially for 5 years after gastrectomy. Gallbladder sludge formation was induced with a high frequency of 42% 1 month after gastrectomy, with corresponding significant lowering of gallbladder contractile function. Most of gallbladder sludges, however, disappeared within 12 months in relation to the gradual recovery of gallbladder contractile function. Conversely, gallstone developed in nine patients (18.8%), mostly more than 6 months after gastrectomy. Interestingly, gallstone formation was induced in seven patients who were sludge negative. An evolvement of gallbladder sludge into stone was observed in only two patients, who were, however, treated with intravenous hyperalimentation. This study first provides evidence for the relationship between gastrectomy and a considerably high frequency of incidence of gallbladder sludge and stone in relation to changes in gallbladder kinetics after gastrectomy.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7255722|Ultrasonic evaluation of patients with acute right upper quadrant pain.|To define the role of ultrasound in evaluating acute right upper quadrant pain, a prospective study was performed on 52 patients having clinically suspected acute cholecystitis. Ultrasonographic determination of acute or chronic cholecystitis, or diagnosis of a normal gallbladder, was based on analysis of location of tenderness, calculi, sludge, and wall thickness. The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (34.6% of patients) was based on the highly significant observations of focal gallbladder tenderness and calculi. Sludge and wall thickening were also statistically significant, but to a lesser degree. Cholelithiasis allowed differentiation of patients with chronic cholecystitis (32.7%) from patients with normal gallbladders (32.7%). Neither of these two groups had significant focal gallbladder tenderness, sludge, or thickened walls. Because acute cholecystitis is found in the minority of patients with acute right upper quadrant pain, and because ultrasound is rapid, accurate, and noninvasive, it should be the initial modality used to evaluate these patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Tokyo Cooperative Gallstone Study Group.|The cholelitholytic action of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was investigated by a double-blind clinical trial. The trial started with 151 subjects all confirmed by radiographic examination as having radiolucent gallstones in a functioning gallbladder. The subjects were divided into three groups receiving 600 mg/day of UDCA, 150 mg/day of UDCA, and placebo (lactose) per day, respectively. Seventy-nine cases were classed as dropouts or were excluded due to incomplete follow-up or inadequate patient selection, and the data on the remaining 72 cases were analyzed. After 6--12 mo of treatment, dissolution of decrease in size or number of stones occurred in 10 of the 29 cases in the 600 mg/day group (34.5%), 4 of 23 cases in the 150 mg/day group (17.4%), and 1 of 20 cases in the control group (5.0%). For those cases with noncalcified, less than 15 mm in diameter, and floating stones, efficacy increased to 83.3% in the 600 mg/day group. Lithogenic index of bile defined by Thomas and Hofmann became unsaturated after treatment in the 600 mg/day group. Neither diarrhea nor hepatic toxicity was noted.

CD010339|9428581|High prevalence of cholelithiasis in a low income Mexican population: an ultrasonographic survey.|The authors present the results of a population-based survey of cholelithiasis carried out in a low-income area of Mexico City using high-resolution gallbladder ultrasound. The purpose of the study was to estimate the prevalence and selected associated risk factors of cholelithiasis (CL). The population of the studied area was 15,532 subjects, of whom 3,505 (22.6%) were eligible for the baseline survey (men and non-pregnant women between 35-64 years of age). Of this group, 1,735 (76.03%, 702 men and 1,033 women) were located for a follow-up study. Ultrasonography was performed on all except for 100 subjects who had undergone previous cholecystectomy. Crude prevalence of CL was 14.1% (95% CI 12.5-15.5). The prevalence was 5.8% (95% CI 4.1-7.5) in men and 19.7% (95% CI 17.3-22.1) in women. Presence of gallstones was associated with age, sex (men p<0.006, women p<0.001), and multiparity (p<0.002). Centrality index in men and body mass index in women were positive and significantly associated with CL when compared with subjects without CL. High levels of fasting and post-glucose load insulin in women and men respectively were associated with CL. The authors conclude that the population of this study has a high prevalence of CL and confirm some known risk factors such as age, sex, BMI and multiparity. Proper assessment of the magnitude problem and characterization of potentially modifiable risk factors will play a major role in preventing this pathology.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The study included 52 patients having either cholecystocholangiography or cystic duct cholangiography. In 13 out of 26 patients (50%) cholecystocholangiography failed because of obstruction of the cystic duct.

CD011549|11193492|[The significance of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in acute cholecystitis].|To clarify the significance of magnetic renonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in the acute phase of acute cholecystitis, MRCP was carried out in forty-five patients with acute cholecystitis in their acute phase. The MR pericholecystic high signal was observed in 38 of the 45 patients (84%). Enlargement of the gallbladder, presence of gallstones, and impacted stones was seen in 71%, 53%, and 18%, respectively. The MR pericholecystic high signal was classified into four categories: type 0, not observed; type 1, a liner high signal; type 2, a band-like high signal; type 3, a radiating high signal. In patients who showed a type 3 MR pericholecystic high signal, 91% required percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage, and most of the gallbladders were diagnosed as necrotic cholecystitis by histology. The accuracy of MRCP for the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis was 96%.

CD010339|8211854|[Radiologic and ultrasound detection of gallstones].|Ultrasonography (US) is the method of choice for evaluation of gallbladder stones with an accuracy of 96%. Number, size and calcification can be assessed by virtue of US reflection and attenuation. If more than five stones are present, the accuracy decreases. To determine the calcium content of stones more precisely, computed tomography can be used. This allows an assessment of the success rate of lithotripsy and chemolysis. Oral cholecystography is an alternative method of similar accuracy as US. It provides additional information about the patency of the cystic duct. In the presence of ductal stones, the accuracy of US decreases to 30%, mainly because of overlying bowel gas. Since 8 to 16% of all cases of cholecystolithiasis are accompanied by choledocholithiasis and since this entails a change in treatment, intravenous cholecystocholangiography with an accuracy of more than 90% is the method of choice in this case. Additionally, it provides knowledge on the biliary anatomy preoperatively. It does not, however, replace US, because opacification of the gallbladder is limited with this method. If intravenous cholecystocholangiography fails in case of impaired liver function, transcholecystic cholangiography or, in cases of dilated ducts, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography can be used.

Some studies have found impaired emptying of the gallbladder in cirrhotic patients. Our aim here was to investigate gallbladder emptying in cirrhotic patients with and without gallstones to find out whether emptying is further impaired in the presence of gallstones. The study group comprised 24 patients with liver cirrhosis and gallstones, 8 in each Child class. The controls were represented by 18 cirrhotic patients without gallstones, 6 in each Child class. Fasting gallbladder volume was calculated by ultrasound using the ellipsoid formula. Gallbladder emptying was evaluated for 90 min after ingestion of a solid-liquid meal (14 g fat, 425 kcal), by assessing minimal residual volume, gallbladder ejection fraction, and area under emptying curve at 15-min intervals. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed Students' t test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. In controls, gallbladder fasting and residual volumes increased with the severity of cirrhosis, but gallbladder emptying did not change significantly. In cirrhotics with gallstones, gallbladder emptying decreased in Child C compared with Child A class patients and, also, compared to Child C controls. The number or size of gallstones, as well as the thickness of the gallbladder wall, did not correlate with gallbladder emptying parameters. Gallbladder contractility is impaired in patients with liver cirrhosis and gallstones. Hypomotility is proportional to the severity of liver disease.

The aim of the present study was to investigate factors related to disturbances in gallbladder emptying measured by ultrasound. Detailed information about weight loss attempts, age at onset of obesity, parity, presence of menopause, use of contraceptive or hormonal replacement drugs, and phase of menstrual cycle was obtained. Smoking habits, alcohol use, dietary intake, and physical activity were recorded. Body composition and fat distribution were assessed by anthropometry. Blood samples were taken for CCK, lipids, glucose, and insulin. Mean (SD) fasting gallbladder volume was 30.0 (12.6) ml. The residual volume was 12.5 (9.8) ml 90 min after a test meal. CCK levels increased from a basal 1.64 (0.8) pM to a peak value of 2.9 (1.0) pM. Fasting gallbladder volumes were closely related to residual and ejection volumes. Body weight and fasting insulin levels explained 35.2% of the variance in fasting volume, lean body mass and insulin explained 28.1% of the residual volume, and waist circumference 23.6% of the ejection volume. None of the other factors were related to gallbladder emptying. Subjects with the largest fasting gallbladders had the largest residual and least emptying gallbladders, scored the highest in every aspect of body size, composition, and fat distribution, and also had the highest insulin levels.

Smoking habits, alcohol use, dietary intake, and physical activity were recorded. Body composition and fat distribution were assessed by anthropometry. Blood samples were taken for CCK, lipids, glucose, and insulin. Mean (SD) fasting gallbladder volume was 30.0 (12.6) ml. The residual volume was 12.5 (9.8) ml 90 min after a test meal. CCK levels increased from a basal 1.64 (0.8) pM to a peak value of 2.9 (1.0) pM. Fasting gallbladder volumes were closely related to residual and ejection volumes. Body weight and fasting insulin levels explained 35.2% of the variance in fasting volume, lean body mass and insulin explained 28.1% of the residual volume, and waist circumference 23.6% of the ejection volume. None of the other factors were related to gallbladder emptying. Subjects with the largest fasting gallbladders had the largest residual and least emptying gallbladders, scored the highest in every aspect of body size, composition, and fat distribution, and also had the highest insulin levels. Body weight, lean body mass, central fat distribution, and insulin levels were the main determinants of gallbladder kinetics. Fasting and residual gallbladder volumes were closely related and both determined by obesity and its metabolic complication of hyperinsulinemia.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones

Most cases are caused mainly by iatrogenic injury and trauma, and are usually located in the sub-hepatic space. Spontaneous biloma is an uncommon entity. We report three rare cases of spontaneous hepatic subcapsular biloma formation in association with choledocholithiasis in two patients and cholangiocarcinoma in one patient. All the patients presented with extrahepatic biliary obstruction with no previous history of abdominal surgery, instrumentation, or trauma. Ultrasound and computerized tomography of the abdomen documented hepatic subcapsular biloma. The patients were initially managed with antibiotics and radiologically guided pigtail drainage of the collections, followed by definitive treatment of their underlying cause.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Early detection, T and N staging and Fine Needle Aspiration plus cithologic confirmation, are some of the expected benefits. Exclusion of benign findings like choledocholithiasis or chronic pancreatitis is also important. A correct understanding of the complex ampullary and periampullary anatomy is needed. Knowledge of the individual clinical history and other previous diagnostic images all contribute to a successful EUS examination. Radial and lineal EUS images are uniquely detailed and, at the moment, it seems to be the best way to exclude or confirm malignant or benign findings. We propose a procedural algorithm, including EUS, for suspected ampullary or periampullary tumors. This review summarizes the vast amount of information to be found spread in the literature, and recognizes this small anatomic area as the origin for a clinical entity with proper clinical presentation, proper imaging and proper therapeutic resolutions.

CD010339|10626165|A case of complex hepatolithiasis successfully treated with a systematic approach.|A systematic approach is required to treat complex hepatolithiasis. A 45 year-old female patient with hepatolithiasis had bilateral intrahepatic stones, biliary strictures at the right hepatic duct and segment IV duct, cholangitic abscess, and shrinkage of the right hepatic lobe. Six sessions of lithotomy were carried out under the guidance of percutaneous transhepatic choledochoscopy using a dye-laser lithotriptor through the segment III duct. Although stones were eradicated from the common bile duct and segment III duct, stones remained in other segments where cholangioscopic access was not feasible. Biliary bilirubin concentration increased and the liver abscess was resolved. Thereafter, the patient underwent right hepatectomy and choledochojejunostomy. After surgery, percutaneous transhepatic cholangio-drainage and balloon dilatation of the segment IV duct was performed. The patient underwent 11 more sessions of cholangioscopic lithotomy through 2 transhepatic routes and the bilioenteric bypass. Thereafter, the patient became almost stone-free. After discharge, biliary tracts were irrigated with saline through a subcutaneously placed reservoir. The patient is alive and well and had been without stone recurrence for 3 years. This report shows the efficacy of the vigorous combination therapy, including repeated cholangioscopic lithotomy through multiple routes using laser lithotripsy, surgery, and long-term biliary irrigation.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|11180878|Rapid intravenous administration of amino acids prevents biliary sludge induced by total parenteral nutrition in humans.|The aim of this study was to evaluate whether daily rapid intravenous administration of amino acids (IVAA) prevented the formation of biliary sludge in humans receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Thirty adult patients receiving TPN for more than 28 consecutive days were studied. They were randomized to receive either saline solution (placebo) intravenously (15 patients) or 6.9% branched chain amino acid (BCAA)-enriched amino acid (15 synthetic amino acids; Freamine HBC) solution given by administration rapid intravenous (15 patients). The groups were similar with respect to age, sex, diagnosis, liver function test results, amylase levels, TPN time, and time of study. All patients underwent weekly ultrasound studies. Volume and emptying studies of the gallbladder in response to the study drug were performed after 1 week. As a result, none of the patients receiving rapid IVAA had sludge, whereas 11 of the 15 patients receiving placebo had sludge (P < 0.01). Results of emptying studies showed significant contraction of the gallbladder in those in the rapid IVAA group, but not in the placebo group. Consequently, the data suggest that rapid IVAA given daily prevents TPN-induced stasis and sludge in the gallbladder. We conclude that rapid IVAA should be used as routine prophylaxis against biliary sludge and formation of gallstones in patients receiving long-term TPN.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD009323|22435160|Single incision tans-umbilical laparoscopic cholecystectomy using conventional laparoscopic instruments: initial experience of single institute.|Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) had been considered the gold standard treatment for symptomatic gall bladder (GB) stones. Single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) was emerged as a less invasive alternative with better cosmesis and less post operative pain. This study evaluated the feasibility, safety, advantages and complications of SILC using the conventional laparoscopic instruments. A total of 52 patients (47 females and 5 males) with symptomatic GB stones underwent elective SILC using the conventional laparoscopic instruments. The mean operative time was 61.75 min and the mean estimated blood loss was 17.21 ml. Gall bladder perforation occurred in 5 cases (9.6%) in which 3 cases calculi spillage occurred. Troublesome cystic artery bleeding occurred in 2 cases (3.8%) while gall bladder bed bleeding happened in 1 case (1.9%). An intraoperative cholangiogram was performed in 3 cases and a drain was inserted in one case. No conversions of the technique occurred. 49 patients discharged in the first post operative day and 3 patients (5.8 %) in the 2nd day. Three month post operative wound length was an average of 1.58 cm while patient satisfaction of the surgery was an average of 9.32.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

CD010339|19322914|Acute pancreatitis: etiology and common pathogenesis.|Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas. The etiology and pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis have been intensively investigated for centuries worldwide. Many causes of acute pancreatitis have been discovered, but the pathogenetic theories are controversial. The most common cause of acute pancreatitis is gallstone impacting the distal common bile-pancreatic duct. The majority of investigators accept that the main factors for acute billiary pancreatitis are pancreatic hyperstimulation and bile-pancreatic duct obstruction which increase pancreatic duct pressure and active trypsin reflux. Acute pancreatitis occurs when intracellular protective mechanisms to prevent trypsinogen activation or reduce trypsin activity are overwhelmed. However, little is known about the other acute pancreatitis. We hypothesize that acute biliary pancreatitis and other causes of acute pancreatitis possess a common pathogenesis. Pancreatic hyperstimulation and pancreatic duct obstruction increase pancreatic duct pressure, active trypsin reflux, and subsequent unregulated activation of trypsin within pancreatic acinar cells. Enzyme activation within the pancreas leads to auto-digestion of the gland and local inflammation. Once the hypothesis is confirmed, traditional therapeutic strategies against acute pancreatitis may be improved. Decompression of pancreatic duct pressure should be advocated in the treatment of acute pancreatitits which may greatly improve its outcome.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Thirty-one patients had LICU examination of the extrahepatic bile ducts after exposure of the gallbladder but prior to dissection of the cystic duct. After LICU examination, cystic duct dissection and cholangiography were done. Evaluation of duct anatomy and decision for duct exploration were based on findings of both tests. All patients had successful LICU examination and 30 had successful cholangiography. Duct size as determined by LICU corresponded precisely with cholangiography.

CD009323|1410361|Intraoperative bile duct sonography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: experience with a 12.5-MHz catheter-based US probe.|During elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 20 patients underwent intraoperative evaluation of the biliary tract with a commercial 6.2-F, 12.5-MHz catheter-based ultrasound (US) probe. The study tested the feasibility of this technology for mapping the anatomy of the hepatoduodenal ligament and Calot triangle, assessing bile duct integrity, and detecting choledocholithiasis. The duct was studied with a transmural approach, the catheter being placed parallel to, but remaining outside, the bile duct. The common hepatic duct and common bile duct in the vicinity of the cystic duct were seen in all 20 patients; the junction of the cystic duct with the common hepatic duct was seen in nine patients (45%). After the cystic duct was clamped, no sonographic evidence to suggest bile duct injury was noted in any patient. The transmural imaging approach was tested in four pigs in whose common bile duct a single human calculus had been placed. In all instances the size and location of the calculus were accurately detected. Intraoperative US with a catheter-based system is a safe and effective means for interrogation of the extrahepatic biliary tree during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.|0|Diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy following computed tomography (CT) scanning for assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic and periampullary cancer

In view of the hypothesis that strains of E. c. form an essential factor in infections of the bile ducts, an attempt has been made to determine the connection between infections of the bile ducts and the adherence of E. c. to the epithelium of the gallbladder. The research covered 148 patients operated electively for cholecystolithiasis (121), cholecystocholedocholithiasis (26) and recurrent lithiasis (1). In bile collected from the gallbladder in the course of the operation, E. coli strains were isolated. Cholangioscopy performed in 26 patients enabled the macroscopic evaluation and grading of inflammatory lesions of bile duct mucosa. The mucosa of the gallbladder was evaluated histologically. The adherence test was performed using homologous and heterologous strains of E. c. isolated from the bile of gallstone patients. The adherence occurred most frequently in the neck of the gallbladder (71-100%) in those patients in whom an infectious process of the bile ducts mucosa was endoscopically diagnosed. The adherence of bacteria to the epithelium of the gallbladder did not depend on the type of inflammation (acute, chronic).|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Genetic mutations of ABCB4 lead to three distinct but related hepatobiliary diseases. Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) type 3 is a chronic cholestatic syndrome characterized by a markedly elevated gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. Patients present with jaundice, pruritus, and hepatosplenomegaly. Periportal inflammation progresses to biliary cirrhosis and causes portal hypertension. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) normalizes liver function tests in approximately one half of treated PFIC type 3 patients. Partial responders or nonresponders eventually will require liver transplantation. Gallstone patients with ABCB4 mutations may have low phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis syndrome, characterized by cholesterol gallstones and intrahepatic microlithiasis, along with recurrent biliary symptoms, despite cholecystectomy. Patients with ABCB4 mutations also may develop intrahepatic brown pigment stones. UDCA may improve biliary symptoms even before the dissolution of stones occurs. Additional therapies such as farnesoid X receptor ligands/agonists and benzfibrates show future therapeutic promise. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy affects pregnant women with abnormal ABCB4. These women suffer from disabling pruritus and also may experience steatorrhea. Fetuses are at high risk for prematurity and stillbirths. The definitive treatment is delivery of the baby. In the interim, limited fat intake, fat-soluble vitamin supplementation, and UDCA with or without S-adenosylmethionine can provide symptomatic relief. Additional hepatobiliary diseases related to ABCB4 mutations are likely to be identified.

In 207 patients with gallstones, gallbladder puncture was performed under local anesthesia with a 22-gauge spinal needle under continuous real-time ultrasound guidance. Bile samples were investigated for biliary lipids and nucleation time. Complete aspiration of gallbladder bile could be achieved in all patients without complications such as bleeding, bile leak, or inflammation. Of these patients, 11.6% reported mild abdominal problems, 3.4% required analgetics, and in 1.0% biliary colics were observed. Elective cholecystectomy was performed in 1 patient. Of the bile samples, 10.1% were contaminated with bactobilia. Biliary lipids, cholesterol saturation index (CSI), total lipid concentration (TLC), and bacteriological contamination were independent of gallstone number, whereas patients with solitary gallbladder stones exhibited a significantly longer nucleation time (NT) in comparison with those with multiple stones.

CD011549|7737635|Diagnostic value of fine-needle puncture of the gallbladder: side effects, safety, and prognostic value.|Bile sampling without the risk of contamination by pancreatic and duodenal secretions and avoiding unpredictable influences of general anesthesia during biliary surgery on biliary analytics are feasible with percutaneous puncture of the gallbladder. In 207 patients with gallstones, gallbladder puncture was performed under local anesthesia with a 22-gauge spinal needle under continuous real-time ultrasound guidance. Bile samples were investigated for biliary lipids and nucleation time. Complete aspiration of gallbladder bile could be achieved in all patients without complications such as bleeding, bile leak, or inflammation. Of these patients, 11.6% reported mild abdominal problems, 3.4% required analgetics, and in 1.0% biliary colics were observed. Elective cholecystectomy was performed in 1 patient. Of the bile samples, 10.1% were contaminated with bactobilia. Biliary lipids, cholesterol saturation index (CSI), total lipid concentration (TLC), and bacteriological contamination were independent of gallstone number, whereas patients with solitary gallbladder stones exhibited a significantly longer nucleation time (NT) in comparison with those with multiple stones.

CD010339|21915383|Cystic duct remnant syndrome.|Post-cholecystectomy syndrome (PCS) is a common manifestation in patients with cholecystectomy. The patients exhibit a heterogeneous group of symptoms, such as upper abdominal pain, vomiting, gastrointestinal disorders, jaundice, and dyspepsia. Choledocholithiasis, biliary dyskinesia, and dilation of cystic duct remnants are common causes of these symptoms. The symptoms can recur after a symptom-free period following cholecystectomy or they can persist after surgery. Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging scan, which are non-invasive methods of imaging, have a high sensitivity in detecting the causes of PCS. We report a case of an 84-year-old lady who came to the Ultrasound Department with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain following cholecystectomy. The gray-scale sonography showed a dilated cystic structure, which was confirmed as the duct remnant in follow-up contrast-enhanced CT.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|2763947|MR appearance of gallstones in vitro at 1.5 T: correlation with chemical composition.|Gallstones from 63 patients were evaluated by in vitro 1.5-T MR imaging, with T1- and T2-weighted images, and in 14 cases, a fat-suppression sequence (short-T1 inversion recovery imaging). Subsequent chemical analysis was performed on 43 gallstones. In vitro proton MR spectroscopy was performed on 14 stones. On T1-weighted MR images, foci of increased signal were seen in 46 of 63 stones (faint in 17, moderate in nine, and bright in 20). T2-weighted images showed areas of increased signal in 18 of 63 stones (faint in 15, moderate in three). T1-weighted MR imaging patterns were homogeneously dark (17), homogeneously bright (two), homogeneously faint (three), rimmed (dark rim and bright center, 32), and laminated (nine). Short-T1 inversion recovery imaging suppressed the foci of increased signal in 13 of 14 cases. Despite imaging characteristics suggestive of high lipid content, spectroscopy revealed only a single peak corresponding to a large water-proton signal. The T1 relaxation times of the water were shortened, ranging from 0.006 to 0.92 sec, explaining the increased signal seen on MR images of the gallstones. MR imaging characteristics (signal intensity, relative signal area, or imaging patterns) did not correlate with chemical composition. We hypothesize that different structural relationships must exist within gallstones of similar chemical content that alter the water bonding and hence the MR imaging characteristics.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was scheduled in eighty-nine of 184 consecutive patients with acute calculous cholecystitis who underwent urgent or early cholecystectomy without bile duct exploration in our department between 1991 and 1998. The correlation between 11 preoperative clinical, laboratory and ultrasonographic variables, and the rate of conversion to open cholecystectomy was studied. Among the 11 variables tested, age and leukocyte count were independent factors of predictive significance. These two factors were used for constructing an additive prognostic index for conversion to open cholecystectomy. Thus, three groups of patients could be identified having a 10%, 30-70% or over 88% risk of conversion.

CD010339|6587545|Specifications of endoscopic ultrasonography.|In this paper we are going to describe the specifications of endoscopic ultrasonography using the equipment type III (Olympus GF- UMI ) on a basis of experiences in 45 patients during the past one year. The main body of the instrument is a standard type of gastroscope, Olympus GF-B3. The ultrasonic probe is incorporated into the tip of the endoscope. This instrument makes possible endoscopic visualization of the UGI tract and, at the same one time, allows us to do ultrasonic scanning of internal organs in the neighbourhood of the UGI tract. The better resolution of ultrasonic image is definitely obtained with this instrument than that of the conventional ultrasonography because its ultrasonography is intraluminally performed with high frequency transducer of 7.5 MHz and the image is never disturbed by the gastroduodenal gas nor the abdominal wall tissues. Endoscopic ultrasonography using the equipment type III is useful as a new diagnostic tool of great value in gastroenterology. However, there still remain a few mechanical points to be improved. It is desired that the rigid section of the tip of the endoscope is shortened more and the stability of the endoscopic image is guaranteed. These improvements would heighten its diagnostic value.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

In a consecutive series of 418 patients undergoing LC, common bile duct (CBD) stones were suspected pre-operatively in 130 patients. Forty-five of the patients (35%) were found to have CBD stones on either pre-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP; 20) or on operative cholangiography (OC; 25). Common bile duct stones were detected on OC in a further 12 of 288 patients (4.2%) without pre-operative suspicion of choledocholithiasis. Of the total of 57 patients with CBD stones, the duct was cleared by pre-operative ERCP and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) in 15 patients. In 13 patients, two of whom had had a pre-operative ERCP and ES, duct clearance was achieved by relaxing the sphincter pharmacologically and flushing the CBD via the OC catheter. One patient had an on-table ERCP and ES with successful stone extraction during LC. Eleven patients were converted to open operation with bile duct exploration. Sixteen patients had a postoperative ERCP. In five patients the CBD stones had passed spontaneously in the time between LC and ERCP. Ten patients required ES to clear the duct of stones. One patient had a failed ERCP and is still awaiting a repeat. The remaining patient was scheduled, but did not return for follow-up ERCP. In summary, pre-operative ERCP was indicated in less than 10% of patients in this series.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Criteria for selection included a history of biliary colic, not more than 3 stones with a total diameter of not more than 30 mm, and a functioning gallbladder. 210 patients were examined, of whom 98 were referred for additional screening by combined ultrasonography and oral cholecystography. This resulted in rejection of another 71 patients due to multiple stones (38%), nonfunctioning gallbladder (22%), calcified stones (12%), stones not visualized in the prone position (9%), excessively large stones (3%) and other reasons (16%). Only 27 patients fulfilled all the criteria. Under epidural or general anesthesia (11 and 2 patients, respectively), we administered 1200-3500 (mean 2250 +/- 750) shock waves at 20-24 KV with the Tripter X1 (Direx, Israel-USA). This is an ultrasound-guided, modular portable, shock-wave generator utilizing underwater high energy spark discharge. Chenodeoxycholic or ursodeoxycholic acid, 10 mg/kg/day, was started 1 week prior to ESWL and continued for 3 months after disappearance of fragments and debris. We encountered skin petechiae in all patients, transient hematuria in 8, mild biliary colic in 1 and a small liver hematoma in 1. To date, 3 patients are free of stones, while in 7 only sludge and tiny fragments are present which we expect to disappear as a result of the litholytic therapy. 3 patients had fragments larger than 5 mm and required a second ESWL.

Complete or partial gallstone dissolution was achieved in 74 (59 per cent). However, only 22 achieved complete gallstone dissolution, as judged by two normal oral cholecystograms; ultrasonograms were performed in 16 of these patients, and all were normal. UDCA was stopped in 76 patients: because of cystic duct obstruction (n = 12), severe biliary pain (n = 13), non-response (n = 25) or partial stone dissolution with arrested progress (n = 26). Life-table analysis showed that complete gallstone dissolution rates at four years were 25-30 per cent (two normal oral cholecystograms) and 17-19 per cent (two normal oral cholecystograms plus one ultrasonogram). All patients with complete gallstone dissolution had shown partial stone dissolution at 6-12 months; of those with partial stone dissolution at six months, only 25 per cent went on to complete gallstone dissolution, and then always within two years. Efficacy correlated inversely with stone size but not with age, sex, obesity or on-treatment saturation indices. Acquired surface gallstone calcification developed in 13 patients (life-table analysis 22 +/- 7 per cent at four years); none of these patients achieved complete gallstone dissolution and only five achieved partial stone dissolution. Thus, despite relatively high partial gallstone dissolution rates, the ultimate efficacy of UDCA in achieving complete gallstone dissolution is low.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Plastic stents, among others, can be used as an escape route in patients with large common bile duct stones, or in cases of acute cholangitis with or without sphincterotomy to provide drainage until definitive treatment. Stent occlusion is the main disadvantage, limiting their patency to around 3 months, after which replacement is recommended. We present a case of a large, close to 2cm, stone developing around and encasing the proximal end of a plastic biliary stent. The stent/stone complex was successfully removed en bloc. The stent was placed in the common bile duct without sphincterotomy, and remained in situ for 2 years. The presented case highlights the importance of definitive treatment for common bile duct stones, the need to respect the ductal axis especially when dealing with large stones and the significance of biliary sphincterotomy during endoscopic interventions in the bile duct.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|15757145|[Bile duct laparoscopic exploration].|The use of ERCP with endoscopic esphincterotomy (ES) for the management of choledocholithiasis has replaced almost completely common bile duct exploration in the era of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Once the procedure is completed it is followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the same hospitalization. During the last few years, the development of new technology and equipment with possibilities of minimal invasive procedures and diagnosis, as well as the ongoing surgical skills has allowed surgeons to solve the problem of choledocholithiasis in one minimal invasive procedure, decreasing effectively morbidity with a high success rate, changing again ERCP with ES as a complement and not as a substitute for surgery. Nevertheless the initial step in the use of these techniques require of a special technical support and what is most important capacitation to achieve the desire objectives. Transcystic technique seems to be the most promising and choledochotomy with primary closure in cases that cannot be solved with the transcystic approach.

CD011548|15757145|[Bile duct laparoscopic exploration].|The use of ERCP with endoscopic esphincterotomy (ES) for the management of choledocholithiasis has replaced almost completely common bile duct exploration in the era of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Once the procedure is completed it is followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the same hospitalization. During the last few years, the development of new technology and equipment with possibilities of minimal invasive procedures and diagnosis, as well as the ongoing surgical skills has allowed surgeons to solve the problem of choledocholithiasis in one minimal invasive procedure, decreasing effectively morbidity with a high success rate, changing again ERCP with ES as a complement and not as a substitute for surgery. Nevertheless the initial step in the use of these techniques require of a special technical support and what is most important capacitation to achieve the desire objectives. Transcystic technique seems to be the most promising and choledochotomy with primary closure in cases that cannot be solved with the transcystic approach.

CD010339|6486112|Gallbladder dynamics in response to various meals: is dietary fat restriction necessary in the management of gallstones?|An estimated 20 million Americans have gallstones the majority asymptomatic. Yet traditionally many are often placed on low-fat or fat-free diets, presumably to reduce the risk of biliary colic. To assess the gallbladder dynamics in response to various meals, we studied 15 subjects (ages 21-54), each on 4 separate days. After an overnight fast, each subject was given, at random, either a breakfast containing greater than 30 g fat, less than 15 g fat, totally free of fat, or an infusion of C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin. Gallbladder ejections at regular time intervals were measured using real time ultrasonography and the sum of cylinders technic corrected for the gallbladder shape. Considerable variability in the gallbladder dynamics and time response was noted with all the stimuli. However, among various meals, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean maximum ejection fraction or the mean maximum ejection time (p greater than 0.10). The mean maximum ejection fraction after cholecystokinin was somewhat greater (0.01 less than p less than 0.05) than that after meals, but the mean maximum ejection time was similar (p greater than 0.10). We conclude that the gallbladder dynamics in response to various meals are independent of a meal's fat content. Since the passage of gallstones into the cystic or common duct (biliary colic) is a random event unrelated to the type of food, fat-restricted diets offer no significant therapeutic advantage in the management of the large population with asymptomatic gallstones.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7060890|Gallbladder function in the human female: effect of the ovulatory cycle, pregnancy, and contraceptive steroids.|We have previously shown that in pregnancy fasting gallbladder volume is increased and emptying after a small volume liquid meal is incomplete. In this study we measured gallbladder volume throughout day and night in healthy women ingesting regular meals. Pregnant women, postpartum women, contraceptive-steroid users, and controls in both phases of the ovulatory cycle were studied. After an overnight fast gallbladder volume was measured by realtime ultrasonography in the fasting state and every 5-10 min for 90 min after breakfast. Residual volume was the lowest volume achieved and the rate constant of gallbladder emptying was calculated from the ln/linear regression of gallbladder volume vs. time. Gallbladder volume was also measured hourly from 11 AM to midnight while subjects ate regular, standard meals, allowing the determination of an average hourly volume. There was no effect of phase of the ovulatory cycle on any measure of gallbladder function. Fasting, residual, and average hourly volume were increased in all trimesters of pregnancy, but tended to return to normal in the postpartum period. Women taking contraceptive steroids had an increased fasting volume. Two distinct rates of emptying after breakfast, an early and a late one, were identified. The early rate was the same in all groups. Pregnant women had a slower late rate of emptying, but women taking contraceptive steroids had emptying rates similar to controls. Retention of bile in the gallbladder may be one reason for the increased risk of cholesterol cholelithiasis in pregnant women and in those taking contraceptive steroids.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

An interim report of the Dornier U.S. Bile Duct Lithotripsy Prospective Study.|A multi-institutional study to evaluate the efficacy, clinical application, and safety of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) with the Dornier HM-3 or HM-4 lithotripter for bile duct calculi (BDC) was initiated in September, 1987. Symptomatic patients who entered into this prospective trial had BDC in the common bile duct and/or the intrahepatic, cystic or lobar ducts of the liver that were inaccessible or untreatable by papillotomy or percutaneous stone extraction. The study excluded gallbladder stones. Nasobiliary (54.4%) or transhepatic catheters (10.5%) and T-tube or cholecystostomy tubes (17.5%) or combinations (14.0%) permitted access for radiographic contrast to allow fluoroscopic monitoring of stone position and fragmentation. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, failure to localize the stone, disturbances of coagulation, pacemakers, or vascular aneurysms or large bones that lie in the focal axis of the shock waves. Eleven institutions treated 42 patients (23 male, 19 female) with BDC; age range was 25 to 95 years (mean +/- SD, 73.5 +/- 13.8) and ASA risk category was 1 to 4 (mean, 2.3 +/- 0.8). Fourteen patients (33.3%) had a single BDC; 28 had 2 to 8 stones (mean, 2.7 +/- 1.8) ranging in size from 6 mm to 30 mm (mean, 18.5 +/- 6.4). The majority (66.7%) of patients were postcholecystectomy. The 42 patients received 57 ESWL treatments consisting of 600 to 2400 shocks per treatment (mean, 1924 +/- 289) at 12 to 22 kV (mean, 18.5 +/- 1.9) administered over 20 to 125 minutes (mean, 52.9 +/- 20.8). General anesthesia was used in 32% of the treatments; the majority were treated with epidural or regional block (42.1%), local infiltration (28.1%), or intravenous sedation (38.6%). Fifteen patients (35.7%) required two ESWL treatments. Stone fragmentation occurred in 94.6% of evaluable patients and in 90.4% of ESWL treatments, respectively; however, BDC fragments remained in 59.5% of patients 24 hours after treatment (diameter less than or to 3 mm, 12%; 4 to 9 mm, 16%; greater than or equal to 10 mm, 68%). Some patients (50%) required adjunctive procedures to achieve stone removal that included endoscopic extraction (n = 10; 47.6%), biliary lavage (n = 8; 38.1%), endoscopic bile duct prosthesis (n = 1; 4.8%), and operation (n = 2; 9.5%). ESWL treatment complications during hospitalization were observed in 15 patients (35.7%) and were present in four (9.5%) at discharge. Complications included macrohematuria (5%), biliary pain (15%), biliary sepsis (5%), hemobilia (10%), ileus (2.5%), and adverse pulmonary changes (7.5%).

CD010339|6287656|A clinical study of cholangiocarcinoma caused cholestasis in Thailand.|Cholangiocarcinoma is the leading cause of cholestasis among patients with malignant tumors, 63.5 per cent, while carcinoma of the head of the pancreas is the most common cause in western countries. A clinical history of progressive cholestasis; signs and symptoms of cholestasis; slow progressive clinical course, and mostly importantly, 96.7 per cent stemming from an endemic area of opisthorchiasis are all shown in this study. The peak age for this disease in Thailand was about one decade younger than that in western countries. The anatomic lesions in 96.7 per cent were found in the hilar area of the liver and only 3.3 per cent in the lower third of the liver compared with a significant number of lesions in the middle and lower thirds of the liver, as reported in literature from the western countries. We believe that percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography prior to the operation will definitely help the surgeon in deciding upon the surgical approach. Surgical intervention of a cholangiocarcinomatous lesion is probably more difficult in Thailand than in western countries because of location. The incidence for cholangiocarcinoma associated with biliary calculi and for an opisthorchiatic cyst is 8.1 and 6.1 per cent. We would like to emphasize the close association between cholangiocarcinoma and the combination of opisthorchiasis with carcinogenic agents, such as nitrosamines in the favorite local dish. The animal experimental model, using Syrian golden hamsters, produced the same result and the same site for the lesion--the hilar area of the liver.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones
CD011548|6287656|A clinical study of cholangiocarcinoma caused cholestasis in Thailand.|Cholangiocarcinoma is the leading cause of cholestasis among patients with malignant tumors, 63.5 per cent, while carcinoma of the head of the pancreas is the most common cause in western countries. A clinical history of progressive cholestasis; signs and symptoms of cholestasis; slow progressive clinical course, and mostly importantly, 96.7 per cent stemming from an endemic area of opisthorchiasis are all shown in this study. The peak age for this disease in Thailand was about one decade younger than that in western countries. The anatomic lesions in 96.7 per cent were found in the hilar area of the liver and only 3.3 per cent in the lower third of the liver compared with a significant number of lesions in the middle and lower thirds of the liver, as reported in literature from the western countries. We believe that percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography prior to the operation will definitely help the surgeon in deciding upon the surgical approach. Surgical intervention of a cholangiocarcinomatous lesion is probably more difficult in Thailand than in western countries because of location.

CD010339|7552015|Prospective evaluation in 121 consecutive unselected patients undergoing laparoscopic treatment of choledocholithiasis.|Laparoscopic common bile duct (CBD) exploration was attempted in 115 of 121 consecutive unselected patients with choledocholithiasis (mean age 69 (range 21-92) years) found during routine intraoperative cholangiography. The CBD was successfully cleared of all stones in 100 patients (87 per cent). Ten of 11 patients referred for surgery after failure of endoscopic sphincterotomy had complete laparoscopic choledocholithiasis. Eleven patients (10 per cent) required conversion to open CBD exploration, and laparoscopic exploration was not attempted in six (5 per cent) because of inflammation or fibrosis. Postoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy was required in four patients (4 per cent) for retained stones after laparoscopic exploration. There were no postoperative deaths (39 per cent of patients were aged 75 years or more). Routine intraoperative cholangiography, and when required laparoscopic CBD exploration, should be compared in randomized trials with preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography in patients with suspected choledocholithiasis.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Common bile duct stones (CBS) were found in four patients (11%, 95% confidence limits 3-25%). Due to a history of jaundice and/or elevated liver function tests, CBS were suspected in three of these patients, and unexpected in one. Totally, CBS were suspected in eight patients, either because of their history and/or elevated liver function tests. No side effects were observed during or after the IVC procedure. It can be concluded that IVC is a lenient procedure for radiological assessment of the common bile duct prior to elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It can be recommended as an alternative to diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiography in patients in whom CBS are suspected.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|8161906|Gallbladder sludge formation after bone marrow transplant: sonographic observations.|We prospectively studied 12 patients before and after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with serial sonography to evaluate gallbladder sludge formation. Patients were studied on four separate occasions to assess the gallbladder for sludge and stones: prior to BMT and conditioning chemoradiation, and on days 3, 13, and 28 after BMT. During two of the sonographic studies, gallbladder volume measurements were made before and after administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-OP) and the ejection fraction (EF) was calculated. Medical records were reviewed for symptoms of cholecystitis, narcotic use, and dietary intake. Sludge and/or stones developed in eight of 12 patients (67%), and in four patients sludge was observed by day 3 post-BMT. Ejection fraction was normal (> 50%) pre-BMT in six of the eight patients who developed sludge, and in four of these six post-BMT. Furthermore, five of the eight patients developed sludge and/or stones in the absence of fasting and/or narcotic use. We conclude that gallbladder sludge develops frequently and early in BMT patients and may resolve or progress to stone formation. We did not demonstrate a relationship between impaired contractility and the development of sludge and/or stones, nor did we find a strong association between sludge formation and conditions presumed to cause gallbladder stasis, such as narcotic use and fasting. These findings suggest that other factors apart from impaired gallbladder contractility may play a role in the formation of sludge in the BMT patient.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|7657495|Malignant potential of the gallbladder in patients with anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal junction. The difference in risk between patients with and without choledochal cyst.|Anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal junction (APBDJ) is considered to be a factor developing carcinoma of the biliary tract. However, the difference in clinical significance of APBDJ between patients associated with choledochal cyst and those without cyst with special reference to the malignant potential of the gallbladder has been little studied. Of 1,325 patients examined with direct cholangiography, 29 patients were found to have APBDJ of whom 21 patients were associated with choledochal cyst while eight were not. Their associated hepatobiliary diseases were clinicopathologically examined and compared. The frequencies of carcinoma of the gallbladder in patients without choledochal cyst and in those with cyst were 50% and 5%, respectively, the difference being significant (p < 0.05). This frequency did not depend upon the type of APBDJ. None of the patients with gallbladder carcinoma had gallstones. The overall frequencies of carcinoma of the biliary tract (gallbladder and bile duct) were 14% in patients with cyst and 50% in those without cyst. All were gallbladder carcinoma in the latter group. We conclude that the gallbladder is under the condition with significantly greater malignant potential in patients with APBDJ especially in cases not associated with choledochal cyst. Prophylactic cholecystectomy and excision of cyst if associated should be indicated for patients with APBDJ.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Thirty patients had periampullary duodenal diverticula, and 14 had no diverticula. Because periampullary diverticula were associated with biliary and pancreatic complications, possibly as a result of stasis in the diverticula, the clinical course in patients with and without diverticula was compared. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was well tolerated and resulted in a rapid clinical improvement in all patients. There were four complications related to the procedure (pancreatitis, two, and cholangitis, two), all were treated conservatively, and there were no deaths. The clinical outcome was similar in both groups of patients. During a mean follow-up of 25 months (range, 6 to 58), only two patients (one of each group) underwent elective cholecystectomy 2 and 3 months after initial presentation. It is concluded that endoscopic sphincterotomy is a safe and effective alternative to surgery as an initial treatment in elderly patients with choledocholithiasis and gallbladder in situ.

CD010339|11505633|Acute pancreatitis in the Zabok General Hospital.|Acute pancreatitis is an acute disease of the pancreas due to the organ autodigestion. The disease is still burdened with numerous complications and quite frequently with lethal outcome, in spite of the sophisticated diagnostic and therapeutic methods currently available. The disease has a benign course in a majority of patients (80%), however, in the remaining 20% it assumes a malignant course with the development of massive necroses of the pancreatic and peripancreatic tissues, infection, hemorrhage, and endogenous intoxication with lesions of the lungs, kidneys, heart and liver. The biliary tract disease plays the major role in the etiology of acute pancreatitis (80%), followed by alcoholism (10% to 15%). This differs from the experience acquired at the Zabok General Hospital, where an almost identical incidence of biliary and ethylic etiology was recorded. Other, less common causes include post-traumatic, postoperative, infective and hormonal (hyperparathyroidism) etiology. In some cases, the cause of acute pancreatitis remains unknown. The disease shows a female predominance, which results from the higher prevalence of cholelithiasis in women than in men. Anatomically, there are two main forms of acute pancreatitis, interstitial or edematous form, and hemorrhagic necrotizing form. The interstitial or edematous form of acute pancreatitis is characterized by edema (exudation) of the pancreatic interstitium. The hemorrhagic necrotizing form of acute pancreatitis is characterized by autodigestion of a minor or major portion of the pancreas and peripancreatic tissues. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis may initially pose a considerable problem. Decision on the mode of treatment should primarily be based on the clinical picture and supported by relevant laboratory parameters and other diagnostic procedures (ultrasonography, computed tomography). Conservative therapy is indicated for the edematous form of acute pancreatitis, whereas operative treatment is as a rule used for the necrotizing form of acute pancreatitis. Secondary bacterial contamination of the necrotic foci with the development of septic complications occurs in more than 50% of patients with the necrotizing form of acute pancreatitis, and is an absolute indication for surgical intervention. The modes of treatment used in 57 patients admitted for acute pancreatitis during the 1996-1999 period are described. Cholelithiasis was the cause of acute pancreatitis in 28 (49.1%), and alcoholism in 29 (50.9%) patients. Conservative treatment was used in 41 (72%) patients. Sixteen (28%) patients underwent operative treatment. Explorative laparotomy and drainage were performed in four patients, and explorative laparotomy, necrectomy, sequestrectomy and drainage with two or more drains in 11 patients. Cholecystectomy and T drainage along with necrectomy and drainage were performed in one patient. There were 12 (21%) patients with the most severe form of acute pancreatitis. Nine of these patients were operated on (necrectomy drainage) between day 6 and 10 of the disease. Two of these patients had to be reoperated on within a month, due to necrosis and abscess recurrence. Three of the 12 patients with the severe form of acute pancreatitis received conservative therapy. Fifteen patients were operated on 8-10 weeks after acute pancreatitis had subsided. Pseudocysts developed in three patients. These patients were operated on 6-8 weeks from the onset of disease, with internal drainage via isolated small intestine flexure performed in all of these patients. The mean duration of intensive care unit stay for all patients with acute pancreatitis was 20.6 days. Four of 57 patients hospitalized for acute pancreatitis died. The mortality rate in the group of patients with the severe form of acute pancreatitis (n = 12) was 33%. Complications developed in 50% of operatively treated patients.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD011549|11505633|Acute pancreatitis in the Zabok General Hospital.|Acute pancreatitis is an acute disease of the pancreas due to the organ autodigestion. The disease is still burdened with numerous complications and quite frequently with lethal outcome, in spite of the sophisticated diagnostic and therapeutic methods currently available. The disease has a benign course in a majority of patients (80%), however, in the remaining 20% it assumes a malignant course with the development of massive necroses of the pancreatic and peripancreatic tissues, infection, hemorrhage, and endogenous intoxication with lesions of the lungs, kidneys, heart and liver. The biliary tract disease plays the major role in the etiology of acute pancreatitis (80%), followed by alcoholism (10% to 15%). This differs from the experience acquired at the Zabok General Hospital, where an almost identical incidence of biliary and ethylic etiology was recorded. Other, less common causes include post-traumatic, postoperative, infective and hormonal (hyperparathyroidism) etiology. In some cases, the cause of acute pancreatitis remains unknown. The disease shows a female predominance, which results from the higher prevalence of cholelithiasis in women than in men. Anatomically, there are two main forms of acute pancreatitis, interstitial or edematous form, and hemorrhagic necrotizing form. The interstitial or edematous form of acute pancreatitis is characterized by edema (exudation) of the pancreatic interstitium. The hemorrhagic necrotizing form of acute pancreatitis is characterized by autodigestion of a minor or major portion of the pancreas and peripancreatic tissues. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis may initially pose a considerable problem. Decision on the mode of treatment should primarily be based on the clinical picture and supported by relevant laboratory parameters and other diagnostic procedures (ultrasonography, computed tomography). Conservative therapy is indicated for the edematous form of acute pancreatitis, whereas operative treatment is as a rule used for the necrotizing form of acute pancreatitis. Secondary bacterial contamination of the necrotic foci with the development of septic complications occurs in more than 50% of patients with the necrotizing form of acute pancreatitis, and is an absolute indication for surgical intervention. The modes of treatment used in 57 patients admitted for acute pancreatitis during the 1996-1999 period are described. Cholelithiasis was the cause of acute pancreatitis in 28 (49.1%), and alcoholism in 29 (50.9%) patients. Conservative treatment was used in 41 (72%) patients. Sixteen (28%) patients underwent operative treatment. Explorative laparotomy and drainage were performed in four patients, and explorative laparotomy, necrectomy, sequestrectomy and drainage with two or more drains in 11 patients. Cholecystectomy and T drainage along with necrectomy and drainage were performed in one patient. There were 12 (21%) patients with the most severe form of acute pancreatitis. Nine of these patients were operated on (necrectomy drainage) between day 6 and 10 of the disease. Two of these patients had to be reoperated on within a month, due to necrosis and abscess recurrence. Three of the 12 patients with the severe form of acute pancreatitis received conservative therapy. Fifteen patients were operated on 8-10 weeks after acute pancreatitis had subsided. Pseudocysts developed in three patients. These patients were operated on 6-8 weeks from the onset of disease, with internal drainage via isolated small intestine flexure performed in all of these patients. The mean duration of intensive care unit stay for all patients with acute pancreatitis was 20.6 days. Four of 57 patients hospitalized for acute pancreatitis died. The mortality rate in the group of patients with the severe form of acute pancreatitis (n = 12) was 33%.

Nevertheless, bile duct injuries and other post-cholecystectomy complications are a serious problem and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Early complications may include bile duct injury caused by mistakenly placed clips, erroneous cutting of bile ducts based on misinterpretation of biliary anatomy, periductal bile leakage that causes edema, fibrosis and secondary stricturing, and ischemia due to injury to the right hepatic artery. Bile duct strictures are the most common of the late complications and can develop a few months or many years after surgery. Early detection and accurate diagnosis have a fundamental importance for the successful treatment of these complications. Therefore, early and meaningful application of the imaging methods immediately after detection of the first symptoms is essential. Peroperative ultrasound and direct iodine contrast application into the biliary tree (operative cholangiography) are highly important for immediate visualization of the complications during surgery. Ultrasound can be used to aid in identification of ductal structures and the cholangiogram should be obtained to document the anatomy.

CD010339|10791226|Doppler sonography in hepatolithiasis: a case report.|"In the treatment of hepatolithiasis, it is important to not only remove all stones and eliminate bile stasis in the biliary tract, but also to remove atrophic hepatic tissue, as such tissue may cause recurrent cholangitis as well as latent cholangiocarcinoma. A 75-year-old woman was diagnosed as having hepatolithiasis with stenosis at the branching of the bile ducts in segment II and segment III by sonography, computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, and magnetic resonance cholangiography. Portograms did not reveal portal branches in segment III but did demonstrate the portal branches in segment II. During the operation, Doppler sonography was done. Doppler sonography did not reveal the portal blood flow in segment III, but did demonstrate a ""to-and-fro"" pattern in the portal branches in segment II, indicating atrophic hepatic tissue with disrupted portal blood flow. Lateral segmentectomy (resection of segments II and III and lithotomy with choledo-chotomy were done. The patient is in good health 2 years 6 months after the operation. Doppler sonography is useful in the detection of disrupted portal blood flow and the diagnosis of hepatic atrophy.

Report of 10 cases and review of the literature in Japan.|During the last 8 years, the authors had experience with 10 cases of carcinoma of the gallbladder with an anomalous connection between the choledochus and the pancreatic duct. These cases were studied in reference to age, sex, frequency of gallstones and dilatation of the bile duct, amylase levels in bile, direct cholangiograms, histologic findings, methods of treatment, and prognosis. Histologically, intestinal metaplasia was noticed in cancerous areas and also in noncancerous areas of differentiated adenocarcinomas. These facts suggest that in carcinoma of the gallbladder with this anomaly, reflux and stasis of pancreatic juice in the gallbladder may induce chronic cholecystitis which leads to mucosal metaplasia and, eventually, to differentiated adenocarcinoma.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Gallbladder status was assessed by ultrasound; fatty acid composition of the habitual diet was estimated by GLC of erythrocyte fatty acids. No differences in erythrocyte fatty acid composition were observed between women without gallstones, women with gallstones (aware and unaware of their condition), and women who had cholecystectomies. Multivariate analysis, including other diet-dependent and gallstone-related variables, showed no significant association between erythrocyte fatty acids and risk for gallstones. However, raised erythrocyte linoleic:saturated ratio was associated with increased risk for gallstones only in women with very low serum triglycerides. This latter finding needs further confirmation and is presently unexplainable. Our results suggest that dietary fatty acids do not play a major role in GD.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

Follow-up ranged from 1 to 14 years after surgery. Check-up examination included: 1) clinical assessment, 2) serum liver and pancreas function tests, and 3) ultrasonography. Good long-term clinical results were obtained in 50 cases. Seven patients complained of mild and temporary hepatic symptoms or digestive troubles. Three subjects developed severe symptoms: jaundice, fever, pain or ascites. The causes of the failures were: 1) recurrent stones in the distal portion of the common bile duct with cholangitis, 2) common hepatic duct stricture with recurrent stones and cholangitis, and 3) alcoholic cirrhosis. The following conclusions may be drawn: 1) Sphincteroplasty achieved a fourteen year success rate of 90% 2) Cholangitis, which supervened in 2 patients, was associated with bile duct strictures and recurrent stones. 3) The great majority of patients who had undergone sphincteroplasty, showed normal size of the bile ducts. However, 10% of patients still retained some degree of intrahepatic ductal dilatation. 4) Since recurrent bile duct stenoses occurred as far as 6 and 8 years after surgery, long-term follow-up is mandatory.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

The following conclusions may be drawn: 1) Sphincteroplasty achieved a fourteen year success rate of 90% 2) Cholangitis, which supervened in 2 patients, was associated with bile duct strictures and recurrent stones. 3) The great majority of patients who had undergone sphincteroplasty, showed normal size of the bile ducts. However, 10% of patients still retained some degree of intrahepatic ductal dilatation. 4) Since recurrent bile duct stenoses occurred as far as 6 and 8 years after surgery, long-term follow-up is mandatory.|0|Endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones
CD010339|1912714|Is ultrasonography a reliable method for evaluation of fragment clearance after biliary ESWL? A prospective, blinded study of two independent ultrasound units.|Ultrasound is the preceding method for evaluation of fragmentation and subsequent fragment clearance from the gallbladder. Considering the methodological shortcomings of ultrasonography, this study was therefore designed to investigate the degree of conformity between two independent ultrasound units. In our protocol patients were evaluated for fragments two weeks and three, six, nine and twelve months after ESWL. A restricted number of experienced sonographers in two independent ultrasound units examined the patient without knowledge of the other unit's findings. A total of 62 examinations have been carried out so far. Complete or sufficient conformity with a difference in size of 0-3mm was achieved in 24 examinations. Seven examinations revealed differences of 4-13 mm. In 31 cases the diagnosis of a stone-free gallbladder has been made, but only in 25 cases this could be confirmed by the other ultrasound unit. In six examinations a small fragment of less than 5mm was found by the respective other sonographer. We conclude that the diagnoses of a stone-free gallbladder after ESWL should be reconsidered by a second independent and experienced sonographer.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones

CD010339|17522376|Eosinophilic cholecystitis, with a review of the literature.|Eosinophilic cholecystitis (EC) is a rare entity that presents in a manner comparable to acute cholecystitis. The diagnosis is based on classical symptoms of cholecystitis with the presence of >90% eosinophilic infiltration within the gallbladder. We report the case of a 29-yr-old man who presented with unremitting right upper quadrant pain, chills, and loss of appetite. After confirmation of the diagnosis with ultrasound and hepatobiliary scan (HIDA), a cholecystectomy was performed. Pathologic examination of the excised gallbladder demonstrated submucosal infiltration with eosinophils, consistent with EC. Peripheral eosinophilia was not observed; the subject's blood eosinophil count did not exceed 3% during the period of observation. The patient was discharged with no further symptoms. Cases of EC have been infrequently reported since its original description in 1949. EC has been reported alone or in combination with manifestations such as eosinophilic cholangitis, hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES), and parasitic infestations. The patient described herein gave no indications of such previously suggested causes of EC. This report illustrates an authentic case of idiopathic EC.|0|Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones
